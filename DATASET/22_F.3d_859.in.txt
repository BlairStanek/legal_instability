You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jacob West was fishing with his son off the coast of Seaside, Hawaii, when a group of porpoises began to eat the fish on the lines. According to statements later taken by officers, Jacob West fired two rifle shots into the water, intending to scare the porpoises away from the catch. No porpoise was struck. At least one fish was partially eaten by a porpoise. A state enforcement officer reported the shots to federal authorities, prompting an investigation and the filing of charges under a federal statute dealing with marine mammals.

 In written statements, Jacob West and his son acknowledged that the shots were fired near the porpoises. They asserted that their purpose was simply to create noise to deter the animals from taking more fish. The federal investigation included interviews, during which father and son reiterated that there was no intention to harm the porpoises. Nonetheless, authorities receiving the officer’s report pursued the matter based on potential violations of the law regulating marine mammals.

 During subsequent legal proceedings, Jacob West raised challenges to the interpretation of the statute at issue, questioning whether firing shots not aimed directly at the porpoises could amount to a prohibited act. The Government argued that any deliberate interference with the porpoises’ activities near the fishing lines could fall within the statutory prohibition. Various regulatory definitions became central to determining whether Jacob West’s actions constituted a legally punishable act. Both sides focused on the statute’s reference to harassment, and they disputed whether Jacob West’s behavior fit within that term.

 In support of Jacob West, it was contended that the law’s definition of prohibited conduct centered on direct harm or severe disruption to marine mammals’ natural routines. Advocates argued that making noise with a firearm to discourage porpoises from eating bait or hooked fish did not amount to killing, capturing, or meaningfully interfering with normal feeding habits. They maintained that the statute should be read alongside regulations that require a substantial alteration of the animals’ customary behavior before liability could attach. They also cited language emphasizing the need for a knowing intrusion, insisting that Jacob West’s intent was only to scare off the porpoises without harming them. This side stressed that private fishermen should be free to take minimal, reasonable steps to protect their catch, particularly if they do not cause lasting damage or interfere with the survival or life-sustaining activities of marine mammals.

 On the other hand, The Government’s position was that the statute and its implementing regulations were written in deliberately broad terms to safeguard marine mammals against a variety of human activities, including the use of firearms intended to alter the animals’ behavior. According to this view, the prohibition on harassment is not limited to physical harm or capture but extends to any intentional act that disturbs or molests these creatures. The Government pointed to multiple examples in regulation and legislative history supporting an expansive understanding of such interference. In their argument, the deliberate firing of a weapon, even if not aimed to strike a marine mammal, constituted a knowing disturbance that fell under the statutory ban. The Government relied on the premise that Congress intended to prevent ill-defined or potentially harmful interactions with marine mammals, and that the issuance of permits or specific exemptions served as the proper method for regulating such intentional deterrence attempts. Under this line of reasoning, Jacob West’s actions were precisely the kind that the statute was designed to address.
