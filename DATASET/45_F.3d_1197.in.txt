You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, Andrew Morris filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that he had been subjected to excessive force. The trial spanned several days, during which the court assembled a jury that initially included a single juror of the same race as Andrew Morris. On a day of severe snowfall, that juror, named Terri Hampton, did not appear. Jordan Kelly and those aligned with Jordan Kelly took the position that, because of the extreme weather and limited court resources, the trial should proceed without waiting for Hampton. Andrew Morris’s counsel asked to arrange transportation for Hampton, but the judge declined due to concerns about the parties providing a juror’s transportation, as well as timing. An alternate juror then replaced Hampton.

 A separate issue involved Andrew Morris’s pretrial requests for production of documents regarding prior and ongoing firearms training within the Metropolis Police Department, including material pertinent to officer preparation and any study of firearms use. The Metropolis Board of Police Commissioners had stated that no relevant firearms-training documents existed beyond annual reports and certain investigative summaries. Andrew Morris, however, continued to demand detailed records of all instances where officers discharged firearms, as well as documents from a firearms-related study. The court ordered production of additional materials and depositions. Some relevant study documents were produced during trial, prompting Andrew Morris to raise motions for sanctions based on delayed disclosure and alleged noncompliance.

 Witness accounts of the incident that led to Andrew Morris’s injury diverged significantly. Andrew Morris and those who supported his version testified that, in the early hours of a new year, he was inside his home when a friend, Elliot Barnes, was in the backyard setting off celebratory gunfire with a shotgun. Andrew Morris stated he was shot in the abdomen while merely looking out from inside his house. By contrast, Jordan Kelly and another officer attested that two individuals in the backyard repeatedly fired a shotgun in their direction, causing Jordan Kelly to return fire, one of the individuals to slump, and then that wounded person to enter the house. Some neighbors also recalled seeing two individuals in the yard with a firearm. Much of the argument centered on whether Andrew Morris was actually outside wielding a weapon or merely observing events from within his home.

 Jordan Kelly’s legal arguments emphasize that the dismissed juror’s absence was supported by a reasonable basis, given the severe weather and the logistical complications. Jordan Kelly points to the court’s need to maintain an orderly proceeding, noting that an alternate was readily available. Citing Batson only for the principle that race-based juror exclusions generally arise from strikes by counsel rather than a court decision tied to neutral circumstances, Jordan Kelly maintains there was no improper motive. With regard to the discovery disputes, Jordan Kelly relies on Los Angeles v. Heller to argue that, once no constitutional violation by any officer is established, broader failure-to-train theories lose significance. Jordan Kelly further emphasizes that accountability for discovery production does not automatically mandate sanctions where belated or partial disclosures arise. Finally, Jordan Kelly references precedents holding that conflicting accounts of an event rest on credibility determinations reserved for the jury, which is entrusted to reconcile factual disputes absent any manifest reason to override its judgment.

 Andrew Morris’s legal arguments focus on the removal of the sole juror who shared his ethnicity, claiming that under principles akin to those cited in Batson, the removal risked depriving him of a fair jury composition. He contends that the court had alternatives, including arranging safe transport, which should have been pursued so that no impression of partiality or disadvantage attached to him. Regarding the discovery issues, Andrew Morris invokes the need for sanctions or even default when a party fails to timely disclose crucial records relevant to a failure-to-train theory. Andrew Morris asserts that the late production of a firearms study, combined with the overall pattern of objections and delays, potentially impeded his ability to present a full case. On the question of evidence weight, Andrew Morris points out that substantial evidence and testimony suggested that he was not the person firing a weapon outside, alleging that any verdict against him would have been based on speculation rather than objective proof. He further argues that courts must be ever vigilant in protecting the integrity of jury deliberations when overt or implicit biases might influence the fact-finding process.
