You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Metro Driver Services, Inc. entered into a series of contracts to transport agricultural products from multiple receiving stations in Montana and Wyoming to a processing facility located in Harristown, Montana. These transport operations occurred seasonally, generally from September until January or February of the following year. Under the first-in/first-out method the company used, drivers were assigned to various routes without regard for whether a route would cross state lines. Fuelers and utility workers provided support for the vehicles used in these operations. The Secretary of Labor brought an action alleging violations of overtime and recordkeeping requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act for individuals employed by Metro Driver Services, Inc. in these different roles.

 Metro Driver Services, Inc. entered the relevant contracts with another private entity—referred to here as Northern Sweetener Company—and conducted transportation services as a motor contract carrier. The Secretary of Labor claimed that for extended periods at the beginning of each operating season, the company’s work was wholly within Montana and did not involve crossing state lines. At some later points in each season, the company arranged or performed interstate trips. Because of this allegedly mixed pattern, questions were raised about which federal agency’s rules applied to the drivers, fuelers, and utility workers during the times when all travel was within one state.

 The corporate owner and principal shareholder of Metro Driver Services, Inc., renamed here as Robert Johnson, faced the possibility of personal liability as an “employer” under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Secretary of Labor argued that Mr. Johnson exercised control over the operations that might make him individually accountable should the company be subject to overtime requirements. As the proceedings advanced, debate arose over whether Metro Driver Services, Inc. was within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Labor or that of the Secretary of Transportation. The resolution of this issue had consequences both for whether overtime must be paid and for whether claims against Mr. Johnson would proceed.

 In contending that Metro Driver Services, Inc. should be subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime provisions, the Secretary of Labor cites 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(1), which exempts employees only if they are under the authority of the Secretary of Transportation for maximum hours of service. The Secretary’s position relies on the principle, set out in decisions such as Morris v. McComb, that a carrier’s workers must actually be involved in interstate trips—or at least have such trips as a regular, non-de minimis part of their duties—for the Secretary of Transportation to exercise jurisdiction. According to this argument, if a lengthy interval of wholly intrastate hauling takes place, then the workers are not operating in interstate commerce at that time. The Secretary of Labor also points to interpretations indicating that a carrier must show concrete evidence of crossing state lines within a reasonable time to avoid coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Secretary of Labor underscores that any exemption to the statute must be construed narrowly, based on decisions like A.H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, and that if the carrier cannot prove actual interstate commerce during the specific periods at issue, it must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act’s overtime requirements.

 For its part, Metro Driver Services, Inc. argues that the company and its employees come under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation because they carry out interstate trucking operations. Drawing on Morris v. McComb, the company notes that it assigns routes to drivers indiscriminately, such that every driver could be called upon to make an interstate trip. Metro Driver Services, Inc. reads the applicable interpretation published by the Federal Highway Administration to mean that once a motor contract carrier has shown recent interstate activity and sets up its routes so that any driver can be used for interstate commerce, all of its drivers remain subject to the Secretary of Transportation’s authority for a set period. The company also contends that its pattern of hauling is seasonal, so a temporary gap in interstate hauling before each season’s first out-of-state load is reasonable when the year is viewed as a whole. According to the company, a strict day-by-day or month-to-month approach would ignore the seasonal realities, and the interpretations of 49 U.S.C. § 3102(b) and related provisions should be flexibly applied to capture their legitimate interstate function.
