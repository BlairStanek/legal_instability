You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


During World War II, certain legislative measures relaxed naturalization requirements for non-citizens fulfilling active-duty service with forces aligned against adversarial powers. Many individuals from the Philippines were called to serve, some directly under the United States armed forces and others within units of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Scouts, or recognized guerrilla forces. Official records of these service members became complicated by the Japanese occupation, which prevented many from applying for naturalization when the laws were temporarily favorable. Everest represents a group of veterans from the Philippines who maintain that they served honorably during this period and could not fully benefit from the earlier relaxed requirements.

 After the war, Everest contends, administrative decisions and logistical obstacles made it difficult for veterans to demonstrate their qualifying service. In particular, a government facility at Ivory City held various rosters, but Everest alleges that these rosters do not include every eligible soldier. Everest offered testimony from Lieutenant Colonel Rowan, who commanded Philippine guerrilla units, explaining that wartime conditions often prevented systematic record-keeping. Some rosters were destroyed for security reasons; others might have been lost or expunged when policies changed. Parkland, on the other hand, interprets these lists to be generally accurate and points to measures taken to reconstruct or verify missing records. This disagreement shapes the heart of the factual dispute.

 Later, Congress enacted Section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990, which aimed to extend naturalization opportunities to individuals from the Philippines who had served at any time from September 1, 1939, through December 31, 1946. Everest reads this statute to include all those who fought in the designated Philippine units, whether or not their names appear in the files at Ivory City. Parkland believes that these veterans must prove their eligibility by documentation issued through official channels of the United States, asserting that only records originating from the United States Army show the service necessary for naturalization eligibility. Both parties cite the text of Section 405, the relevant provisions in Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the interplay between those provisions.

 On one side, Everest argues that Congress intended Section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990 to be broadly remedial, ensuring that those who rendered honorable service are recognized despite difficulties in record-keeping. Everest emphasizes language in that statute which expands eligibility to those in the Philippine Army, Philippine Scouts, or recognized guerrilla units, contending that this shows a deliberate choice to include those not necessarily on official U.S. Army rosters. Everest stresses that Congress, through legislative history and statements by figures such as Representative Mays and Senator Swift, proclaimed an intent to remedy the decades-long exclusion of these veterans. Everest cites the principle in Tcherepnin v. Knight that remedial legislation should be read in a manner favoring those it intends to help. Everest also claims that requiring documentation exclusively from U.S. Army lists would be inconsistent with the inclusion of veterans who served solely under Philippine command, depriving them of the statutory benefit Congress pledged.

 On the other side, Parkland asserts that when the relevant statutes speak of an “executive department under which the petitioner served,” it necessarily refers to a department of the United States. Parkland insists that only a duly authenticated certification from such a department conforms to Section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which is explicitly referenced by Section 405. Parkland points to the longstanding rule that naturalization requires strict compliance with statutory procedures, and it notes that Title 5 of the United States Code recognizes specific executive departments of the United States government. Parkland argues that since these provisions were originally designed for service in the United States military, the extension to Philippine units does not negate the requirement that a U.S. agency certify any claimed service. Parkland cites Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council to emphasize that a government agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous provision should stand, maintaining that requiring documentation from the United States Army ensures uniformity and minimizes the possibility of fraudulent claims.
