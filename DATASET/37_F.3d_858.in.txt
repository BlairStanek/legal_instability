You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, Jonathan Wright was prosecuted for structuring a currency transaction in violation of 31 U.S.C. §§ 5324(3) and 5322(a). After a jury trial, he was found guilty, and the court imposed a sentence consisting of one year of imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release. Wright sought further review and continued to challenge the propriety of his conviction and sentence.

 Wright was initially incarcerated beginning on November 30, 1990. Partway through his prison term, he became eligible for a transfer to a non-governmental community facility, named here as Hope Recovery Center, on July 29, 1991. He remained at Hope Recovery Center until November 27, 1991, when he was released just before a holiday. From that point, Wright began to serve the supervised release portion of his sentence.

 As Wright neared what he believed was the end of his supervised release period, his counsel attempted to file a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Counsel went to the district court on November 26, 1993, but discovered that the clerk’s office was not open on that day. Counsel then returned on November 29, 1993, and filed Wright’s habeas petition. Subsequent proceedings raised questions about whether Wright’s sentence, including supervised release, had expired by November 26, 1993 or instead extended beyond that date—an issue that affected whether Wright was still “in custody” for purposes of bringing a federal habeas motion. These questions centered on whether any early release from Hope Recovery Center could shorten the overall sentence, and whether the day the clerk’s office was closed would have any effect on the timeframe for filing.

 One position emphasizes that jurisdiction to bring a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 depends on the person’s “in custody” status. Proponents of this view invoke cases such as Maleng v. Cook, Carafas v. LaVallee, and Jones v. Cunningham to argue that once a term of supervised release concludes on its natural end-date, there is no longer a meaningful restraint on liberty to satisfy “in custody.” They further rely on provisions indicating that federal courts lack authority to reduce the duration of a sentence absent specific statutory authorization, maintaining that dormancy at the clerk’s office or closures for holidays do not extend such status. This view contends that because “in custody” is a statutory requirement, procedural rules like Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) cannot alter the essential condition that the individual remain subject to a criminal sentence while filing.

 The other position underscores that the count of days or months of custody and supervised release should be carefully assessed, particularly in light of the original term of imprisonment and the precise date it ended. Advocates of this stance note that early release from a community center might not necessarily accelerate the start of supervised release, thus leaving open the possibility that the sentence expired later than officially reported. By extension, they argue that a filing may be timely if the true date of release from all custody was on or after November 29, 1993. Furthermore, these proponents reference Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) to suggest that where courthouse closures prevent timely filing, the date for filing is extended to the next open business day. They stress that a strict interpretation of deadlines without considering practical realities—like extended holidays or local court scheduling—could unfairly deny a petitioner the chance to be heard when the individual attempted to file on a day the court was not accessible.
