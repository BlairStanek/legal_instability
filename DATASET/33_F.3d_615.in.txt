You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Adam Whitmore and Courtney Whitmore are siblings from Yugoslavia and identify as ethnic Albanians. They entered the United States in 1986 without inspection. Soon after their arrival, the INS initiated deportation proceedings against them. Both siblings requested asylum on grounds that they had been politically active in Yugoslavia in support of civil rights for ethnic Albanians and feared repercussions if returned.

 In Yugoslavia, Adam Whitmore studied at the University of Ashford (in Montenegro). While there, he claims to have publicly opposed the government by creating and displaying Albanian flags and slogans, removing official signage, and helping organize Albanian students expressing similar views. He was arrested and allegedly beaten during multiple police interrogations. Courtney Whitmore lived with their parents in Kenwood (also in Montenegro) and was detained once overnight after the police reportedly discovered Albanian cultural materials in her room. Both siblings maintain that they expected lengthy imprisonment or further harm upon return to Yugoslavia, especially given their family’s past history of political persecution.

 After arriving in the United States, both Adam and Courtney took part in what they describe as additional pro-Albanian civil rights activities, joining an emigré group led by an Albanian priest named Ian Roberts and participating in protests. They contend that Yugoslav law punishes citizens who engage in certain types of political expression abroad and believe their government might have monitored their activities in Parkvale. Meanwhile, the INS argued that any fear the siblings might have could be inconsistent with certain facts—such as the siblings receiving valid Yugoslav passports, traveling abroad without impediment, and Adam’s ability to continue his studies after the alleged arrest episodes. Procedurally, there was also a question of whether the siblings were required to pursue further administrative challenges once an immigration judge entered an order designating Yugoslavia as the destination for deportation and granting voluntary departure.

 In support of their position, Adam Whitmore and Courtney Whitmore invoke statutory provisions that define a “refugee” as someone facing persecution based on political opinion. They contend that their political expressions in Yugoslavia—posting cultural and political symbols, supporting Albanian civil rights in public and private gatherings, and belonging to groups considered hostile by Yugoslav authorities—trigger the statute’s protections. They rely on case law indicating that persecution can be found when nonviolent expressions of dissent result in arrests or beatings. They also cite observations that a “well-founded fear” does not require a probability exceeding 50%, but rather a reasonable likelihood they would face punishment for their political views. They point to evidence that Yugoslavia had, in some instances, criminally prosecuted individuals for criticisms made while abroad, reinforcing their claim that they face a serious risk if deported.

 The INS advances an alternative statutory argument, maintaining that the siblings must demonstrate that any feared harm in Yugoslavia directly stems from protected political opinion and not from ordinary law enforcement actions. The INS emphasizes that issuing passports and allowing the Whitmores to depart might undermine the notion of systematic political targeting. The INS also suggests that the siblings’ allegations of past harm may not suffice to show an ongoing, well-founded fear, pointing to the fact that, for some period, Adam traveled freely, resumed studies, and secured opportunities while still in Yugoslavia even after the alleged incidents. In addition, the INS argues that if there was an administrative route for challenging the final deportation order or raising new evidence, such remedies should have been exhausted before seeking further review. According to the INS, statutory cases dealing with final orders of deportation require a thorough use of administrative appeals, and courts have sometimes declined review when a party has not appealed to the proper administrative forum in a timely manner.
