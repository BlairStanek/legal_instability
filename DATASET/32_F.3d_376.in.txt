You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Diane Harris taught full-time in Summerville Educational District for many years and then began working there as a substitute. At one point, Harris substituted in a seventh-grade classroom, after which a Black student, Jordan Price, allegedly told his regular teacher that Harris, who is also Black, had used a racial slur directed at him. The regular teacher conveyed this report to Patricia Grant, an assistant principal who also served as a counselor in the school.

 Grant spoke with Price and then interviewed other students, who she later said corroborated Price’s account. Harris was never questioned during this investigation. Grant then informed Walter Brown, the superintendent for Summerville Educational District, about the accusations against the substitute teacher. Brown, without consulting Harris or speaking further with any of the students, immediately removed Harris from the list of approved substitutes in the district.

 Harris denies ever using a racial slur. She states that Brown knew who she was and was aware of her race before choosing to remove her from the substitute list. The building principal, Thomas Martin, asserts that substitute-teacher complaints were normally his to investigate, and he had planned to give Harris an opportunity to respond. However, Martin learned that Brown had already removed Harris’s name from the substitute list. Harris notes that she had a long, positive teaching record in the district and contends that Brown did not sufficiently investigate the situation.

 In support of Summerville Educational District, legal arguments rely on the principle that an employer may act on a belief of employee misconduct if there is a legitimate reason to do so, citing federal and state provisions pertaining to nondiscrimination claims—such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983, and the Missouri Human Rights Act—together with precedent emphasizing an employer’s prerogative to dismiss based on perceived wrongdoing. These arguments suggest that the superintendent possessed a genuine, good-faith belief that Harris had made a racially disparaging remark to a student and point to the assistant principal’s stated corroboration of the accusation as justifying the decision to remove Harris from the substitute list. Under these arguments, the school district is entitled to rely on such a report and take immediate steps to address the situation if it believes the conduct undermines acceptable standards for teachers. The school district’s position is that this constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action.

 In support of Diane Harris, legal arguments urge that the charge of misconduct was never substantiated by any thorough inquiry, so the stated reason for her removal could be a mask for racial bias. These arguments invoke the same federal and state antidiscrimination statutes and emphasize the need for an employer to be honest in its reliance on an accusation and to allow an adequate response from the accused. According to Harris, Brown’s abrupt action, and his purported failure to speak with her or conduct a more extensive review, create an inference that the assertion of a racial slur was neither believed nor independently confirmed. Such an inference, these arguments maintain, opens the possibility that Harris’s race formed part of the true motivation for the discharge, and that insufficient evidence existed to show the school district’s rationale was genuine.
