You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Harper sued the City and County of Redwood under federal civil rights laws after being arrested multiple times for alleged violations of a California statute that criminalizes certain types of begging. Harper had never been formally charged for these arrests. He sought damages, as well as a declaration that the statute in question was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Even though Harper had found steady employment by the time the lawsuit was underway and was no longer engaged in begging, he pursued his dispute based on the claim that these past arrests had violated his constitutional rights.

 The City and County of Redwood, joined by the State of California as an intervenor, argued that Harper lacked a personal stake in any request for an injunction because he had stopped begging. Nonetheless, Harper asserted that he retained standing to challenge the statute, especially in connection with his past arrests for which he was claiming damages. As the litigation proceeded, the City and Harper agreed to settle the damages portion of the case for a set monetary figure. However, disagreements subsequently arose about whether the declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the statute would remain in place or could be appealed.

 The settlement the City offered did not explicitly reserve the City’s right to challenge the ruling that the statute was unconstitutional. Afterward, the City sought to modify or undo the judgment, arguing that the absence of any express reservation regarding its appellate rights was a mistake or misunderstanding. Meanwhile, the State of California, having intervened to defend the statute, also attempted to participate in the City’s efforts to preserve a route to appeal. Issues arose as to whether the final judgment and dismissal of damages claims meant there was no longer a viable controversy over the statute’s enforcement. There was further conflict over whether the prior ruling on unconstitutionality should remain in effect or be vacated in light of the settlement and the evolving circumstances that potentially rendered Harper’s claim for declaratory relief moot.

 In favor of Harper, several legal arguments appear. One is that the final judgment on damages, combined with a declaration that the statute violates federal constitutional rights, validly resolved his entire dispute that had arisen from his arrests. Proponents of this view emphasize that Harper had already been subjected to arrests in ways that directly involved the constitutionality of the challenged statute, bolstering his claim for a declaratory ruling. They rely on precedents establishing that a plaintiff who seeks damages for a constitutional violation may also pursue a related declaration of unconstitutionality if the claims share common operative facts, pointing to decisions such as Giles v. Ackerman and Smith v. City of Fontana. They further argue that any confusion over appellate rights does not negate Harper’s settled interest in the outcome, because the settlement terms resolved the essential injuries and did not authorize revisiting the constitutional determination. Supporters of Harper additionally contend that, in cases involving alleged free speech violations, courts have sometimes applied more flexible standing principles, ensuring a sufficient basis for a party to test the statute’s constitutionality when they have demonstrated a risk of harm linked to past enforcement actions.

 In favor of the City and County of Redwood, other legal arguments appear. One is that once Harper was no longer panhandling and had settled any damages claim, there was no ongoing live controversy to justify a ruling on the statute’s constitutionality. This argument draws upon the requirement that a person seeking declaratory relief must show a continuing or imminent threat of injury, as taught in cases like City of Los Angeles v. Lyons and O’Shea v. Littleton. The City also asserts that because Harper no longer engaged in the regulated conduct, he could not have argued a genuine prospect of future harm, meaning the court should not have decided the constitutional issue in the first place. Additionally, the City and County of Redwood invokes principles that if an appeal becomes moot because of events ending the live dispute—such as a fully executed settlement—courts have discretion to vacate any constitutional ruling that is left without an adversarial context, focusing on the equitable concerns rooted in decisions like United States v. Munsingwear. They further maintain that it is unfair for them to be bound by an unreviewed declaration of unconstitutionality when they had intended to preserve their right to appeal and believed the final arrangement would allow it.
