You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In West Virginia, ABC Mountain, Inc. operated a ski area known as Willowpeak Resort. James Johnson and two companions, Diane Roberts and Paul Brown, were skiing an expert slope called the Thunder Rock trail. During Johnson’s second run, he passed through a plume of snow from a snowmaking device. He claimed that this wet snow froze on his goggles, causing him to lose sight of the trail. He then veered off and hit a tree, resulting in severe injuries. Johnson sued ABC Mountain, Inc., alleging that the company was negligent in its placement and operation of the snowmaking equipment.

 Johnson contended that ABC Mountain, Inc. maintained the snowmaking device in a manner contrary to its own policies, including guidelines for pointing the device downhill and producing snow dry enough so as not to impair visibility. He also argued that the open section of the trail was too narrow for safe passage alongside the snow plume. Witnesses testified that the snow was indeed wet and that the plume obstructed portions of the trail, although not all recalled seeing Johnson visibly impacted by the spray.

 ABC Mountain, Inc. denied any negligence, pointing to its need to align the snowmaking device with existing winds and testifying that only half of the trail was covered by the plume, leaving sufficient room for skiers to pass safely. The company also noted that Johnson might have been skiing too fast at the edge of the run. Some testimony indicated there was a second snowmaking device located farther down the slope, and Johnson later questioned whether the existence of that device had been adequately disclosed. During the trial, Johnson sought to introduce extensive expert testimony from Dr. Kyle Barnes regarding wet snow conditions and the placement of the devices, but the court limited Dr. Barnes’s testimony to the scope of general safety policy rather than specific snowmaking practices.

 In support of ABC Mountain, Inc., it was asserted that general negligence instructions fully encompassed any potential breach of duty under relevant law, including the West Virginia Skiing Responsibility Act. Proponents of this side maintained that the Act places certain responsibilities on skiers to avoid inherent risks, such as variations in terrain and weather-related conditions, which can include snow projected from machines. They contended that referencing the Act’s language about the limits of resort liability was appropriate, as it clarifies that a ski area is not automatically responsible for every natural or artificial hazard. They further argued that excluding an expert’s opinion on specialized snowmaking procedures was correct when the expert lacked experience in that technical area, citing principles that an expert’s testimony must be grounded in reliable and relevant expertise. They also suggested that whether the trail was adequately maintained is determined by whether reasonable care was taken to operate equipment in light of changing wind patterns, leaving a clear path for skiers to proceed. Lastly, they noted that omitting more specific instructions on wet snow and equipment direction was consistent with the broader principles of negligence law, which do not necessarily require a jury instruction on each factual detail so long as the law is stated accurately.

 In support of James Johnson, it was asserted that specific instructions addressing the resort’s own snowmaking policies and the alleged wetness of the snow were necessary so the jury could properly evaluate whether those policies were violated. Proponents of this side emphasized that the West Virginia Skiing Responsibility Act sets forth an operator’s duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, which can include proper placement and operation of snowmaking devices. They argued that listing inherent risks under the Act in general instructions might obscure the key issue: whether ABC Mountain, Inc. failed to follow its own stated policies of pointing the device downhill, ensuring the snow was dry enough not to impair visibility, and leaving enough space on the trail for safe skiing. They contended that the second snowmaking device, and any lack of disclosure about it, was relevant to establishing the full scope of the resort’s operation on the slope that day. Additionally, they asserted that the limitation on the expert witness’s testimony prevented the jury from receiving critical information linking the resort’s snowmaking practices to Johnson’s injuries. Consequently, they maintained, the jury needed a clear, detailed statement of the specific negligence claims so it could adequately decide whether ABC Mountain, Inc. departed from established safety standards.
