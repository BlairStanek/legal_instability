You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Stone was driving a Company X rental truck along Highway 17 in County A, Missouri, when Trooper Sam Jones of the Missouri State Highway Patrol pulled him over in the evening hours. Trooper Jones later testified that he had observed an abrupt lane change without a signal. During the initial encounter, Trooper Jones asked Stone for his driver’s license and the rental agreement for the truck. Both documents indicated Stone had rented the truck under the name Jordan Stone (a/k/a David Roberts). Stone appeared to Trooper Jones to be nervous, and Stone’s eyes appeared red. Trooper Jones also said he detected a strong deodorizer odor coming from the cab of the truck.

 Trooper Jones asked Stone to exit the truck and sit in the patrol car. Stone complied, partially opening his door to step out. After Trooper Jones checked Stone’s documents, Stone answered various questions about his travel, explaining he was moving from City B, Arizona, to North Carolina, and planned to visit his fiancée in Pennsylvania along the way. Trooper Jones believed Stone’s responses were vague regarding his former employer and the precise location of his fiancée, and the officer also noted Stone carried a pager on his person. Trooper Jones asked Stone if he was transporting contraband. Stone did not give consent to a search, and Trooper Jones called for a drug dog.

 Stone was told that he could not leave with his vehicle, although he was informed that he was not under arrest. Because Stone needed to use the restroom, Trooper Jones and another officer, Trooper Ryan Davis, escorted him to a zone office of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, with Stone himself driving the truck in front of Davis. Upon arrival, Trooper Jones administered a field sobriety test, which Stone passed. Roughly an hour passed from the time of the initial stop until the drug dog arrived. The dog alerted to the truck, and a search revealed over seven hundred pounds of marijuana bundled in boxes. Deodorizers and other similar items were also discovered in the cargo area.

 In support of Jordan Stone’s position, the arguments focus on whether the officer’s actions constituted an unlawful detention and subsequent search. One argument is that the basis for the stop, an allegedly unsignaled lane change, was pretextual and, even if the stop was valid at the outset, the officer exceeded permissible bounds by continuing to question Stone about matters unrelated to the traffic stop after Stone’s documents proved valid. Citing Terry v. Ohio and its progeny such as United States v. Cummins and United States v. Jefferson, these arguments assert that once the officer’s initial inquiry was concluded, retaining Stone’s license and rental agreement while posing unrelated questions amounted to a seizure without reasonable suspicion. Stone’s supporters also argue that nervousness or red eyes alone do not justify an extended detention and that the presence of a pager and a strong odor in the vehicle can be equally consistent with entirely innocent behavior. They claim that absent a clear showing of objectively reasonable suspicion rooted in specific facts, the transition from a brief investigative stop to a protracted detention violated Stone’s Fourth Amendment rights. Further, they emphasize that any evidence obtained from the resulting search should be excluded because the asserted lack of reasonable suspicion tainted the entire chain of events.

 In favor of the United States, the arguments emphasize that the officer had ample cause for further investigation once Stone displayed signs of unusual nervousness and the truck emitted what appeared to be a strong masking odor. These points, combined with Stone’s limited or evasive responses concerning his trip, are asserted to have provided a legitimate basis to suspect drug activity under Terry v. Ohio. The United States cites cases such as United States v. Weaver to argue that law enforcement officials are permitted to rely on training and experience in assessing whether factors like a driver’s demeanor, use of a pager, and unusual smells might indicate criminal conduct. Because Stone did not consent to the search, the United States contends Trooper Jones acted with diligence by quickly requesting a drug dog, a recognized minimal intrusion under Place, and that the overall length of the stop was proportionate to the time needed to confirm or dispel suspicions. Once the dog signaled the presence of drugs, officers had probable cause to conduct a warrantless search under the automobile exception articulated in precedent. Under these arguments, the officers’ steps to secure the vehicle and Stone’s person were necessary to preserve officer safety and ensure the investigative process could proceed, making the search and subsequent evidence collection proper.
