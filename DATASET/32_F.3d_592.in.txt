You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In late 1982, Foxwood Supplies Company obtained a contract with Thomas City to furnish a chemical compound. Soon after, Foxwood Supplies Company and Feinster Industrial Incorporated agreed that Feinster Industrial Incorporated would be Foxwood Supplies Company’s source for the chemical. As part of their arrangement, they set up an escrow mechanism with Malton National Bank. Under that mechanism, payments from Thomas City relating to the chemical deliveries would be deposited into the escrow account at Malton National Bank, and Feinster Industrial Incorporated would in turn be paid from that account.

 According to Feinster Industrial Incorporated, the parties expected this escrow setup to continue at least as long as the underlying supply contract did. Over a span of years, fees for the chemical were invoiced, and Feinster Industrial Incorporated received payments through Malton National Bank. At some point, Thomas City began sending checks directly to Foxwood Supplies Company, which then sometimes deposited funds into the escrow. Malton National Bank complied with the instructions issued through Foxwood Supplies Company, paying invoices for Feinster Industrial Incorporated when directed. Eventually, Feinster Industrial Incorporated claimed it was owed over a million dollars for deliveries it had made but for which it had not been paid.

 Malton National Bank later merged with another institution, which became insolvent. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over as receiver once the insolvency was declared. Feinster Industrial Incorporated contended that the escrow remained in force by conduct of the parties, even though the original writing describing the escrow’s duration had referenced an earlier date. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, stepping into the role of the failed Malton National Bank, disputed Feinster Industrial Incorporated’s ability to enforce any purported continued escrow obligations based on theories that no formal, written extension was properly documented in the bank’s records.

 Feinster Industrial Incorporated relies on multiple legal arguments suggesting that an agreement like an escrow need not be treated as an asset-based contract. They contend that under principles governing separate fiduciary obligations, the bank’s role as escrow holder was distinct from a typical loan or note, thus not falling under strict formal recordkeeping requirements. Feinster Industrial Incorporated argues that fairness and reasonable commercial understanding support the idea that a written escrow, even if it mentions a time limit, can be renewed by consistent behavior and by the bank’s own assurances. They contend that certain doctrines, such as those explained in the case law interpreting common contractual extensions and fiduciary duties, allow proof of an extended relationship based on the parties’ conduct. They maintain that any federal law—like the provisions under 12 U.S.C. §§ 1823(e) or related doctrines—should not bar claims when the very nature of the disputed relationship involves the bank’s duties to hold and pay out funds that did not belong to the bank itself. They further point to precedent suggesting that when a bank’s fiduciary or escrow responsibilities are involved, reliance on consistent procedures and oral confirmations can be shown through evidence that the underlying arrangement was intended to continue alongside the commercial contract.

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation presents equally firm arguments that an escrow arrangement, especially if its written terms expired, must satisfy formal compliance in order to bind a failed institution’s receiver. Pointing to doctrines established in D’Oench, Duhme & Co. and related authorities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation maintains that any prolonged or changed escrow obligations must appear in the formal bank records. They assert that even services like escrow administration could constitute part of the bank’s portfolio, meaning any undocumented extension risks misleading regulators about the true liabilities of the bank. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stresses that under 12 U.S.C. §§ 1823(e), as clarified in various court precedents, no agreement can be enforced against a failed bank’s receiver unless explicit written requirements are met. The agency argues that these protective measures safeguard deposit insurance funds and ensure swift, reliable evaluations of a defunct bank's standing by examiners. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concludes that holding a receiver strictly accountable for unrecorded extensions of a written agreement beyond its stated term would undermine the certainty that federal law is intended to guarantee in resolving a bank’s assets and liabilities.
