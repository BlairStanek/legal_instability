You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Price began working in 1978 for Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation as a security guard. He is African American and held that position for several years. Over time, Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation hired other individuals, who were younger and white, to serve as security guards. Mr. Price played a role in training these other security guards, yet they later received promotions that included advantages such as salaries and profit-sharing benefits.

 Eventually, Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation eliminated its security guard positions and assigned the former guard duties to foremen. Mr. Price was moved to a janitorial role, and, though his pay rate was initially maintained, he did not receive profit sharing. After a period of performing both janitorial tasks and some guard-related duties, Mr. Price was released from his job when the company decided to contract for outside janitorial services. The contract was with Wheeler Janitorial Services, an African American–owned company, for about a year. After that, Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation used some of its own employees, who were white females, to handle janitorial tasks.

 Mr. Price was not offered a reduced or part-time version of the janitorial job, nor was he offered any other position within Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation when his original role was dissolved. Mr. Price claimed he was qualified to perform the kind of work—whether full-time or part-time—that Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation ultimately needed filled. In response, Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation maintained that it chose more cost-effective methods for covering janitorial tasks by initially using an outside contractor and then shifting the work to existing employees. In the course of this dispute, both sides focused on whether Mr. Price’s qualifications and tenure should have led the company to keep him in some capacity.

 In support of Mr. Price’s position, it is argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the standards drawn from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green impose a flexible framework for demonstrating that an adverse employment action can be traced to discrimination. Mr. Price’s account emphasizes his membership in a protected group, his proven skills, and the employer’s choice to transition his job to other workers or an outside service. Advocates for Mr. Price point to alleged disparate treatment, suggesting that less qualified employees outside Mr. Price’s protected group received better or comparable positions, including promotions and profit-sharing rights, while he was never similarly offered a raise or promotion. Case law such as Mitchell v. Worldwide Underwriters Insurance Co. is cited to suggest that, in reduction-in-force situations, an employer’s failure to consider an existing employee for an available position can support an inference of race discrimination. This argument notes that Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation continued to have a need for janitorial services—even if in a different format—and that Mr. Price was never provided a nondiscriminatory explanation for not being offered that part-time or adjusted role before the job was given to others.

 In support of Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation, it is contended that businesses retain a fundamental right to structure their workforce and shift tasks to independent contractors or other individuals in a way they consider operationally or financially beneficial. The company cites the position that Title VII does not require an employer to retain a specific individual when there is a legitimate cost-based reason to outsource or reorganize. Case law principles emphasizing that the law does not obligate employers to create new positions or modify existing ones beyond recognized practices are invoked. The company’s perspective stresses that Mr. Price’s former role was eliminated in good faith, that the work was handled in cost-effective ways, and that any incidental hiring of white part-time workers, or use of an outside contractor, was based on practical efficiency rather than discriminatory intent. Mercury Plumbing Ceramics Corporation further notes that no formal policy existed through which it offered part-time arrangements whenever it dissolved a position, and that the absence of such a policy or custom undermines the suggestion of discrimination.
