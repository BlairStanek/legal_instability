You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan Doe is the warden at the Iowa State Penitentiary. Taylor Smith, an inmate there, brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and pursued habeas corpus relief. Smith contends that he is illiterate and incompetent, such that he has a procedural due process right to receive counsel substitute at disciplinary hearings and classification reviews. He also claims that he has serious medical issues—specifically epilepsy—that are not properly addressed.

 According to the record, Smith suffered childhood meningitis leading to brain damage, has borderline intellectual functioning, and reads at a limited-grade level. He experiences an explosive temper and endures epileptic seizures treated with standard anticonvulsant medications administered by prison staff. After Smith was severely assaulted by another inmate, Chris Park, prison officials placed Smith in protective custody at his request, and later continued that placement involuntarily based on an assessment that Park and associated inmates endangered Smith.

 During the four years Smith remained in involuntary protective custody, he was disciplined on many occasions for misconduct, which resulted in extended stays in lockup and the loss of multiple good time credits. At classification reviews, Smith continually protested remaining in protective custody, but prison officials maintained that safety concerns outweighed the risk of returning him to the general inmate population. Smith never formally requested counsel substitute at these proceedings, although he now asserts that his limited cognitive abilities demanded such assistance. He also alleges that his seizure condition worsened in protective custody and that the warden should have facilitated an alternative drug regimen or specialist evaluation.

 One major legal argument offered for the first party is based on the principle that, under Wolff v. McDonnell, there is no overarching requirement for counsel or counsel substitute at prison disciplinary hearings. This position holds that the constitutional prerequisite is limited to giving inmates an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. Counsel substitute becomes relevant, in this view, only in narrow circumstances where an inmate is illiterate or the issues presented are unusually complex, a standard that may not extend to Smith. Additionally, the first party cites Brown v. Frey for the idea that any broader rule undermines the legitimate administrative prerogatives of prison officials. Adhering to regulations that ensure assistance “as necessary” is argued to satisfy all due process requirements.

 The other major legal argument contends that Smith’s cognitive impairments, exacerbated by an explosive personality and susceptibility to confusion, place him within the category of inmates who require counsel substitute to ensure fair proceedings. Drawing on passages in Wolff v. McDonnell that address illiterate or seriously compromised inmates, it emphasizes that Smith’s limited communication skills make it unlikely he can gather and present the needed evidence or arguments. This argument maintains that classification decisions further implicate due process because protective custody can affect a significant liberty interest and potentially worsen health issues. Supporters of this view cite the notion that medical care for epilepsy, including more specialized evaluations, should be part of the prison’s duty when the inmate’s condition is not improving under the current regimen. Cases like Alston v. DeBruyn are referenced to reinforce that when significant freedoms and well-being are at stake, heightened procedural protections may be needed.
