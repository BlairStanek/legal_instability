You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1970, the Park Service entered an arrangement that called for granting a roadway easement over Meadow Lane Parkway in exchange for the conveyance of Sweet Grass Marsh along the Elkhorn River. Under the terms of the arrangement, Greenbloom & Associates transferred ownership of Sweet Grass Marsh to the Park Service, and the Park Service was to allow future access from the Parkway to Riverwalk Center, a tract initially leased by Greenbloom & Associates from Warrington, Halford & Eastern Train Company. The easement, designed to facilitate commercial and residential development on the leased property, underwent multiple reviews and required the approval of several government bodies before construction could begin.

 Greenbloom & Associates ultimately ended its lease with Warrington, Halford & Eastern Train Company when design approvals for the roadway interchange did not materialize. Some time later, Warrington, Halford & Eastern Train Company itself sought to utilize the existing arrangement, taking the position that it had succeeded to Greenbloom & Associates’ rights. Various governmental entities subsequently approved a detailed interchange design granting direct access to Riverwalk Greens, the proposed development project on the land. After public announcements regarding that project, Parkland Island Preservation Society brought suit, alleging that both the original 1970 agreement and the subsequently approved design ran afoul of several federal requirements.

 Parkland Island Preservation Society focused on the contention that the arrangement improperly committed the Park Service to an exchange that diminished conservation values near Meadow Lane Parkway and Parkland Island. According to its challenge, the arrangement and subsequent approvals violated certain statutory duties relating to historic preservation, floodplain management, and orderly urban planning. The Park Service asserted that it had considered many interchange configurations and believed it had sufficiently minimized the impact on local wetlands, open spaces, and potential historic sites. During the litigation, disputes arose over the timeframe in which the suit could be brought, including whether any time bar might foreclose challenges to the 1970 exchange commitment.

 Arguments in favor of the Park Service posit that the 1970 arrangement created a binding obligation on the Park Service to provide roadway access across Meadow Lane Parkway once designs were approved by the necessary agencies. Proponents of this view maintain that the Park Service, over a period of years, exhaustively studied numerous design alternatives to mitigate traffic, environmental, and floodplain concerns. Supporters of the Park Service’s position further propose that the National Park Service Organic Act allows broad discretion so long as the Park Service’s ultimate action is not arbitrary or capricious. They also highlight that the National Historic Preservation Act was satisfied because the relevant federal advisory body was invited to comment, and the National Capital Planning Act was fulfilled by consulting with the appropriate planning authority. Lastly, this side points to Executive Order No. 11988 compliance, asserting that potential flood hazards were examined and that modifications, such as altered ramp elevations, were instituted to reduce damaging effects. In addition, they contend that limitations on suits challenging government transactions must be consistently applied and that the Park Service’s defense of a statutorily prescribed deadline should remain viable under federal precedent.

 Arguments favoring Parkland Island Preservation Society counter that the Park Service could not contract away its continuing statutory obligations and that all viable options, including halting or modifying the project more substantially, should have been formally reviewed under federal environmental, preservation, and planning statutes. They maintain that defaulting on or acquiring a release from any private agreement should also have been evaluated so that natural and historic resources would remain unimpaired for public enjoyment. Regarding the National Historic Preservation Act, supporters of Parkland Island Preservation Society emphasize that significant local landmarks might be affected and that more extensive consultations were imperative. Under the National Capital Planning Act, they argue that prior negative findings about the project’s consistency with regional plans should have prompted reevaluation, not acceptance of the arrangement as inevitable. They also note that Executive Order No. 11988 and floodplain guidelines meant reconsidering whether constructing no interchange at all was a viable alternative, which they say was never seriously explored once the 1970 exchange was deemed binding. Lastly, on procedural grounds, they contend that any reliance by the Park Service on a time-based defense was rendered moot by years of litigation wherein that defense did not surface in substantive arguments, demonstrating a waiver or abandonment of any such limitations bar.
