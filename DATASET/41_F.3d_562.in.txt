You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


During World War II, the United States lost access to key sources of natural rubber abroad, including in Malaya, and contracted with several private companies to build and run a government-owned synthetic rubber facility. Thames Manufacturing operated one portion of the complex tasked with producing certain chemicals, while Radford Rubber, Acorn Elastics, and River Petroleum operated other portions for related manufacturing steps. The raw inputs and final chemical products were owned by the United States, which also paid fees and reimbursed these entities for their work. Over time, the plant site changed hands and was eventually purchased by Serenity Properties.

 Thames Manufacturing’s role included supplying fresh material (styrene) to Radford Rubber and Acorn Elastics for conversion into synthetic rubber. Those two entities would return used material that had become impure in the rubber-production process back to Thames Manufacturing, which would then remove the impurities so the cleaned product could be reused. This cycle continued periodically, with each entity carrying out its assigned role under agreements with the United States.

 The operations on the site gave rise to concerns about chemical remnants left in pits on the land, prompting Serenity Properties to bring a legal action under CERCLA seeking to recover cleanup costs. Thames Manufacturing sought contribution from Radford Rubber and Acorn Elastics, among others, alleging liability tied to the handling and transfer of the impure substances. Meanwhile, the contracts with the United States included indemnity provisions, and some parties argued these provisions should shield them from liability. Questions arose about whether simply following government directives in a wartime effort, and dealing with material that still had market value, might affect any liability determination.

 Those supporting Thames Manufacturing’s position contend that Radford Rubber and any similarly situated companies arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances under CERCLA. They argue that returning impure materials for re-distillation constituted more than a mere sale, pointing to provisions in the agreements setting a per-pound charge for each return and claiming that this effectively amounts to paying a fee for removing contaminants. They direct attention to language in CERCLA and to various case precedents interpreting “arranger” liability, which hold that ownership or direct control of the process is not necessary. They emphasize that the cyclical contamination, re-distillation, and re-use of the material could be interpreted as evidence of an arrangement for treatment under governing statutes.

 Those supporting Radford Rubber’s position contend that Radford Rubber was merely performing duties assigned by the United States in producing a needed war material. They emphasize that all materials were government-owned, that the process generated a valuable substance to be reused, and that any impurities were a byproduct of making synthetic rubber for the nation’s war effort. They maintain that Radford Rubber did not meaningfully direct or arrange the final disposition of contaminants, especially given that the United States retained ultimate ownership and responsibility for the materials. They invoke CERCLA provisions and legal precedents that require a genuine decision to dispose of or treat waste, noting that there was little choice about following government directives at the time and that the substance retained value throughout its reuse cycle.


Based on the facts above and your knowledge of the law, think step by step to figure out which party should prevail: Thames Manufacturing or Radford Rubber
