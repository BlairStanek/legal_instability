You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Megan Baker, recently separated from her husband, lived in a trailer community with her two children, Luke (ten years old) and Diana (approximately two years old). Because Megan Baker worked late shifts at a local tavern, she sometimes left Diana under the care of Roger Adams and Sarah Peterson, neighbors who had a child of their own. Diana appeared to be comfortable in their care, and Megan Baker did not observe any physical indications of harm during that period. Shortly thereafter, Megan Baker began using another daytime caretaker, Anna James, who looked after multiple children.

 One day, Anna James heard Diana make remarks suggesting that Roger Adams had done something harmful to her. According to Anna James’s account, Diana used the word “medicine” to describe what Roger Adams had supposedly done. Anna James, alarmed by these statements, had a conversation with Diana asking for additional details. Diana then made further remarks about Roger Adams but also, at a later point, denied that any harm had happened. Megan Baker, upon learning of these alleged statements, recalled that Diana had previously used the word “medicine” at home in a puzzling context. Concern arose within the local Victim Witness Office in Evergreen County, which arranged to have Diana taken to a specialized setting, the Center for Child Safety at the Kids’ Wellness Center in another city (here called “Coastal City”), for an interview and a medical evaluation.

 At the Center for Child Safety, a social worker named Erin Turner conducted a videotaped interview with Diana. During the thirty-minute recording, Diana made several statements about Roger Adams that included references to “medicine” and other descriptions of physical contact. In the ensuing medical examination, Dr. Maria Lopez documented certain physical conditions in Diana that she believed could be consistent with repeated episodes of abuse. Meanwhile, Diana had also uttered inconsistent claims about whether Roger Adams had or had not harmed her, and at one point suggested that Megan Baker herself might have been involved in a related or separate act. Some of these statements were disputed by Megan Baker. Although no direct eyewitness testified at the trial, other individuals—including Anna James and Megan Baker—relayed what they had heard Diana say on multiple occasions.

 On behalf of Roger Adams, one key argument invokes the constitutional principle that a criminal defendant must be allowed to confront and cross-examine witnesses, relying on Idaho v. Wright and Ohio v. Roberts. According to this position, the introduction of Diana’s videotaped interview and any statements attributed to her should be subject to strict scrutiny under confrontation rules, especially given her very young age and possible exposure to adult questioning over time. Supporters of Adams also argue that the taped statement lacked particularized guarantees of trustworthiness because of inconsistencies in Diana’s accounts, potential coaching, repeated questioning by multiple adults before the recording, and the possibility that a two-year-old might adopt or confuse details. They further suggest that any hearsay exception relating to medical diagnosis should not apply if the interview was conducted primarily to gather evidence, rather than to treat or diagnose Diana’s condition. Additionally, they emphasize that the physical findings, though possibly suggestive of abuse, are not definitive about who might have caused any harm and cannot, by themselves, substitute for in-court testimony tested through cross-examination.

 On the other side, the State of Arizona contends that Diana’s videotaped statement is admissible under recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, claiming it bears adequate indicators of reliability in light of Idaho v. Wright. The State argues that the social worker, though not a physician, interviewed Diana in a setting akin to a medical context, ultimately leading to a follow-up exam by Dr. Maria Lopez. They assert that the child’s age-appropriate terminology, combined with some degree of spontaneity, shows that she was describing experiences beyond what she would naturally invent. Pointing to the medical findings, the State emphasizes that there was a legitimate investigative and diagnostic purpose in questioning Diana. They also cite the repeated nature of her allegations in various settings, contending that her statements were sufficiently consistent regarding essential details. According to the State, any minor contradictions or retractions are unsurprising for a child of Diana’s age and do not overcome the presumed reliability of statements given for purposes of checking on her well-being and health. The State next indicates that standard confrontation rules may yield to a carefully validated child statement if it appears trustworthy enough to be placed before a fact-finder, again invoking Idaho v. Wright and other precedents that permit hearsay in child-protection scenarios when safeguards are observed.
