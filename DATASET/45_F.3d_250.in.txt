You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alan Turner is a Missouri inmate serving a twenty-year prison sentence for receiving stolen property and hindering prosecution. He sought relief through a writ of habeas corpus, raising the issue that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance. Before his trial, he had filed a request seeking new representation, claiming that his lawyer was not adequately defending him.

 After trial, Alan Turner again raised dissatisfaction with his legal representation, and the trial court noted there was probable cause to believe he might have received ineffective assistance. The court ordered the filing of a notice of appeal and allowed the original lawyer to withdraw. New counsel was appointed for the appeal. Turner later hired another lawyer to handle that appeal. Under Missouri procedure, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is normally brought in a post-conviction motion under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 29.15, separate from the direct appeal.

 Alan Turner’s newly retained lawyer pursued the direct appeal but did not file a Rule 29.15 motion. Several months after his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, Turner himself filed a pro se Rule 29.15 motion raising multiple points, including ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but this filing came too late under the procedural rules in Missouri. Around that same time, the trial court’s order had instructed new counsel, if grounds existed, to file a timely post-conviction motion. However, there was no such motion filed in time by counsel. As a result, the state courts did not address Turner’s allegations of ineffective assistance on the merits through a Rule 29.15 proceeding.

 In support of Matthew Cruz, one argument emphasizes that procedural rules in Missouri require that any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel be raised in a timely Rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, and a failure to do so defaults the claim. This argument explains that, under Wainwright v. Sykes, claims omitted under a state’s established procedures cannot be revived in federal court absent a showing of cause and prejudice. Citing Coleman v. Thompson, it is asserted that ineffective assistance of counsel during post-conviction proceedings does not qualify as sufficient cause to overcome such a default, because the post-conviction process is separate from the direct appeal. Foster v. Delo is offered as further precedent that missteps by counsel in a collateral proceeding do not excuse a default, and the set of rules outlined by Missouri Supreme Court Rule 29.15 is portrayed as mandatory and clear. Therefore, it is argued, the governing law reinforces the procedural rules that bar a late claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and the default should stand under these legal authorities.

 In support of Alan Turner, one argument underscores that there was judicial recognition of a probable cause basis to suspect ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the sentencing stage, which led the court to replace the original lawyer. Based on that development, it is contended that an official action—namely, the order for new counsel to determine whether a post-conviction motion should be pursued—created a reasonable expectation for Turner that a timely Rule 29.15 motion would, in fact, be filed. This external factor, it is urged, prevented him from acting more promptly on his own. Additionally, it is argued that under Murray v. Carrier, external impediments, including an attorney’s failure to follow a court’s directive, can constitute the cause needed to overcome an otherwise forfeited claim. Reference is made to Parkus v. Delo for the principle that when a defendant relies on official acts and then suffers counsel’s failure or inaction, procedural default should not stand in the way of a potential remedy. Consequently, these authorities are offered to show that the late filing of the Rule 29.15 motion was excusable and that Turner’s claim of ineffective assistance deserves judicial consideration on the merits.
