You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Officers in Utah stopped a car for speeding. The car’s driver was one woman, and another woman was in the front passenger seat. Morgan Davis and Travis Field were in the back seat. The stopping officer detected a burnt marijuana odor and discovered rolling papers near Morgan Davis. A small piece of marijuana was also found on him. The officer then searched the vehicle’s interior and the trunk, ultimately finding a loaded pistol and around 113 grams of crack cocaine hidden behind the trunk’s lining.

 According to one of the women in the vehicle, she and her friend initially left Woodville on a plane to Bayville after the friend received calls about someone known as “Cameron Lee.” The plan was to return to Woodville with Cameron Lee, yet they ended up staying in a motel overnight. The next day, they rented a car in the woman’s name using a credit card from the friend’s mother. The group then took this rental car and traveled to several locations in Bayville before driving toward Woodville. Along the way, Morgan Davis and Travis Field placed clothes in the trunk, and at times stood behind the open trunk. The woman stated she never saw either of them holding the gun or the drugs.

 At trial, the Government relied on the woman’s account of the trip and on the officer’s discovery of both contraband items. The woman acknowledged that the group’s departure involved a sudden plan to fly one way to Bayville, pick up two men, and drive all the way back to Woodville. She also recalled that Morgan Davis briefly looked under the dashboard and under the hood of the rental car before they began the return trip. After the traffic stop in Utah, when they were outside the car, Morgan Davis made a statement that could refer to harming the stopping officer, though the exact meaning of his remark was not clearly established. The defense maintained there was no direct proof showing either Morgan Davis or Travis Field hid the gun or drugs in the trunk.

 In support of Morgan Davis and Travis Field, it was argued that the Government had not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals had actual or constructive possession of the contraband. They cited principles from 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and related case law requiring proof of control or knowledge. The defense claimed that circumstantial evidence must be based on logical inferences rather than speculation. They stressed that the woman’s statements did not place the gun or the crack cocaine in either man’s hands or luggage and that no fingerprint or forensic analysis tied the men to these items. They pointed to the possibility that the contraband might have been present before the car was rented or placed there by another person. From this perspective, any inferences connecting Morgan Davis and Travis Field to the weapon or drugs were said to rest on mere conjecture, lacking a clear tie between them and the contraband. They also noted that, under precedents concerning sufficiency of evidence and constructive possession, the Government must provide substantial proof that the accused had power and intent to exercise control over the illicit material.

 The Government, in turn, argued that the totality of the circumstances established enough evidence of guilt for the charges of possession with intent to distribute and violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). It pointed to the smell of burnt marijuana, the presence of rolling papers, and the men’s apparent attempts to hide something when they opened and stood near the car trunk. The Government further contended that taking a sudden one-way trip to Bayville and then driving back to Woodville with unknown companions was suspicious. Referencing case law permitting a jury to rely on circumstantial evidence, the Government insisted that a reasonable jury could find that the proximity between the gun and drugs, combined with the men’s behavior and lack of any clear explanation for their presence on the trip, created a valid inference of control. Under relevant legal principles, the fact that the weapon and crack cocaine were close to each other and left readily accessible in the trunk, the Government maintained, was enough to suggest the men carried the firearm during drug trafficking activities or had it available to protect narcotics in transit.
