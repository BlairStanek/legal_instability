You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The dispute centers on how the Hours of Service Act should treat the time a train crew spends waiting for transportation back to its designated release point after the crew has reached the maximum number of consecutive hours on duty. The first party, the Federal Railroad Administration, previously changed its interpretation to treat this waiting period as on-duty time. By contrast, the second party, Westlake Rail Corporation, contends that such waiting time should be categorized differently. The issue arose after certain court decisions discussed the distinction between time actually spent operating or moving a train, time accounted for as travel to begin a shift, and other periods that may not clearly fit either category.

 Both sides acknowledge that federal law sets a maximum of 12 consecutive hours on duty for train crews and imposes minimum rest requirements before those crews may be called back to service. After 12 hours, a crew must essentially cease operating the train. Often, a separate relief crew takes over, and the original (“outlawed” or “expired”) crew waits for transportation to a designated release terminal. The Federal Railroad Administration’s recent interpretation treats the interval spent waiting for a ride back to the terminal as on-duty time. Westlake Rail Corporation disputes that classification, pointing out that the Act already addresses time spent in transportation itself, which has historically been deemed “limbo” time rather than fully on or off duty.

 During legislative hearings tied to amendments of the Hours of Service Act, the question of whether waiting periods should count among time limitations was discussed. Both parties agree that safety is a paramount concern of the Act, though they dispute whether including or excluding waiting time best furthers that goal. Some historical materials and legislative reports have addressed the differences between employees actively engaged in operating a train and those who are relieved from operational duties. Scenes in which a crew, no longer moving the train, remains near it or departs to a nearby location to await a ride illustrate differing views of whether that waiting should be counted within the maximum permissible shift.

 Several arguments strongly support the Federal Railroad Administration’s position that waiting time should be counted as on-duty time. First, the plain text of the Hours of Service Act is read to emphasize that any period in which crew members remain under certain obligations connected to train movement or supervision can be considered part of their duty. Second, prior court rulings under similar circumstances have been cited, indicating that the waiting associated with potential continued responsibilities is indistinguishable from time devoted to operating or otherwise tending to the train. Third, case law such as United Transportation Union v. Skinner is used to show a consistent judicial interpretation that time spent waiting after relief from active operation, but before final release, falls under the category of on duty. Fourth, officials charged with administering railroad safety reference the Act’s safety objectives, explaining that if individuals must remain near or responsible for the train in any nominal capacity, the law’s spirit is best served by including that time under the 12-hour limit to guarantee sufficient rest later.

 Equally forceful arguments support Westlake Rail Corporation’s position that waiting time must not be on-duty time. First, legislative materials from amendments to the Hours of Service Act highlight that the primary hazard arises when employees are required to continue with the actual operation of trains. In that view, waiting after relinquishing control of the train poses a different scenario and should be assigned to the category more akin to deadhead or “limbo” transportation time. Second, Westlake Rail Corporation underscores that the statutory language calling out “time spent in deadhead transportation” is neutral about waiting before that ride begins, and the best reading severs the mere act of standing by from active control or operation. Third, historical practice recognized a difference between driving a train (which is on-duty) and waiting to be picked up—many have contended that this waiting does not prompt the type of mental or physical demands the law seeks to limit. Fourth, the argument is that, once a relief crew arrives, the original crew is incapable of resuming responsibility for the train legally, meaning safety concerns for unauthorized operation no longer justify attributing the waiting period to on-duty hours.
