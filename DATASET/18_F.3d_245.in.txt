You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Howard Jenkins worked as a sheet metal worker in the employ of Harper Rail Transport. He was stationed in a rail yard located in Greenwood, Kentucky, where a loud, high-pitched noise allegedly caused him injuries. The employee described this noise as emerging from a piece of equipment known as a retarder, which slows the motion of rail cars. Jenkins was present only a short distance away from where the rail cars entered the retarder, and claims that the noise resulted in tinnitus, other ear-related troubles, and emotional distress.

 According to Jenkins, the retarder within the Greenwood yard was obsolete and produced an extraordinary noise on that particular occasion, triggering physical and emotional harm. Some coworkers testified that the yard was a busy location and that retarders generally make noise any time rail cars pass through them. One coworker recounted that he had not previously heard such a loud noise in that area, while another stated that noise regularly accompanies retarder use. There was also evidence that certain employees in the past had complained about loud noise from retarders, prompting some efforts by the employer to reduce excessive sound levels or otherwise address potential safety concerns.

 Medical witnesses testified that Jenkins exhibited tinnitus and related distress after the incident. One doctor attributed these issues to the alleged noise exposure, while another suggested alternative causes, including the possibility that ringing in the ears might arise from normal conditions unrelated to workplace factors. Additionally, it was contended that Jenkins’s anxiety and nervousness stemmed from the same cause. Jenkins emphasized that the resulting emotional distress led to missed time at work and required medication. Harper Rail Transport contended that there had been no prior knowledge of any extraordinary danger from that specific retarder and that yard workers often avoided hearing protection due to a need to remain alert to oncoming trains.

 In support of its position, the first party has relied on legal principles outlined in the Federal Employers’ Liability Act and precedents such as Inman v. Baltimore & O. R.R. and Atlantic Coast R.R. v. Craven, noting that railways are not absolute insurers of safety. It argues that hazards are inherent in rail operations, and an employer can only be held liable for failing to exercise reasonable care. It emphasizes the absence of any defect that could be detected through inspection, claiming there was no actual or constructive notice of an extraordinary noise and no foreseeable basis to anticipate a single loud event. The first party also insists that its duty to provide a safe workplace must be understood in the context of rail yard necessities—retarders are essential equipment designed to slow cars, and hearing protection in busy areas may pose its own risks by preventing workers from hearing approaching trains. On these grounds, it contends that even under a FELA standard, evidence of negligence should demonstrate knowledge of the hazard, a discernible defect, or a failure to conduct reasonable inspections, none of which it believes is established here.

 In defense of its position, the second party draws on the same FELA framework yet stresses the importance of employer diligence under precedents such as Gallick v. Baltimore & O. R.R. and Shenker v. Baltimore & O. R.R., which underscore an employer’s ongoing duty to provide employees with a safe work environment. It highlights testimony that the retarder may have been obsolete and that the rail yard was a location of high traffic where loud noise reoccurred. The second party asserts that the employer should have foreseen the possibility of excessive noise or recognized flaws in the retarder, given the direct link between noise-producing equipment and ear injuries. It argues that the presence of regular high decibel sounds in the yard, coupled with prior complaints and alleged attempts to mitigate them, should have placed the employer on notice; thus, the failure to take consistent precautions and ensure that the retarder met safety standards constitutes negligence. By this reasoning, foreseeability and a failure to eliminate or reduce the known risk are central to establishing liability.
