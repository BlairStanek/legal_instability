You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Adrian was alleged to have been distributing marijuana in the Westville region. Adrian arranged for Taylor, an individual acting with the knowledge of a government agency, to travel from Kansas to Westville to receive a sum of money generated from marijuana sales. Upon arriving, Taylor took possession of the money from Jonas, who ceased further involvement afterward. Subsequently, Taylor turned the funds over to a federal agency. Adrian gave Taylor instructions aimed at retrieving the money from that agency, and Taylor then portrayed that he had secured the funds in the form of a check.

 At Taylor’s urging, Adrian agreed not to travel personally to Fairview to receive the purported check. Instead, Adrian sent Winston, who was related to Adrian, to go to Fairview in his stead. Winston and Taylor discussed whether the funds, once cashed, would be converted to large bills, and they synchronized the timing for Winston’s arrival. Winston traveled to Fairview, and once there, Winston and Taylor negotiated a payment for Taylor from the contents of the money bag. Winston contacted Adrian for approval, and permission was granted to pay Taylor two thousand dollars from the supposed proceeds.

 Winston made arrangements to fly to California the day after taking possession of the bag that purportedly contained the funds. Unbeknownst to Winston, the bag contained only scrap paper. Officials detained Winston immediately after he accepted the bag. Throughout the various relocations of the alleged proceeds — originally planned from Westville to California, then rerouted through Fairview — Adrian was said to have orchestrated the steps to retrieve and redirect the funds, while Winston’s role was to pick up the package and travel onward to California.

 In support of Glover’s position, arguments point to legal authority such as 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and Pinkerton v. U.S. They highlight that Winston took active measures beyond merely holding or moving the money. Winston’s request for larger bills, it is contended, demonstrates awareness of the illicit source of the proceeds and an intent to obscure that source by facilitating easier concealment. Glover’s arguments emphasize that Winston’s agreement to pay Taylor out of the supposed proceeds, combined with his coordination on flights and other logistics, indicates participation in a broader plan designed to hide the ownership and nature of the funds. Under theories of vicarious liability, these arguments maintain that Winston would be accountable for Adrian’s actions once Winston joined the venture, as any additional steps taken to shift or disguise the money could be attributed to Winston as part of the collective effort.

 In support of Winston’s position, arguments note that the mere physical transportation of money or the act of hiding cash on one’s person does not necessarily meet the statutory definition of a financial transaction designed to conceal the nature or source of illegally obtained funds, citing interpretations of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and similar provisions. Winston’s counsel emphasizes that requesting larger bills is not the same as obscuring the criminal character of the proceeds, but rather reflects a desire to avoid detection of possessing any cash at all. Further, it is asserted that Winston was not involved in the arrangement with the federal agency or the details of the check-based scheme, and thus had no part in disguising the origin or type of proceeds. According to Winston’s arguments, working with Adrian, who was interacting with a government informant, does not automatically render Winston a participant in any plan to launder funds—instead, the evidence shows merely a covert effort to carry money from one place to another, without any purpose to hide its illegal nature.
