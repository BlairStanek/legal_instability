You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, Michael Clark was traveling by train operated by National Railway through Greenvale, New Mexico. He and two companions, one of whom was Kevin Brown, had reportedly purchased their tickets with cash on board the train—rather than at a station—from the conductor. A train attendant told Detective Ramirez that two men kept a tan duffle bag with them while moving around the rail cars. The detective, along with Agent Edwards, was already conducting surveillance and received additional information from another train attendant. On this basis, the detective approached Clark and Brown when they were seated in one of the coach cars.

 When Detective Ramirez and Agent Edwards made contact, Brown showed the detective a ticket that indicated three travelers had boarded in Glendale, even though the detective believed the travelers had boarded in Riverton. The detective perceived this as inconsistent with the statements from Clark and Brown about their embarkation point. In response to the detective’s questions, Brown allowed a search of his garment bag, where the officers found nothing unlawful. Clark consented to a search of his brown suit bag but refused consent to search the tan duffle bag. Soon thereafter, the officers removed the tan bag from the train and took it to a location roughly five minutes away for a dog sniff. Later, the bag was opened pursuant to a search warrant, and contraband was found.

 Some accounts in the record suggest that paying cash for tickets purchased on board might be innocently explained by factors such as lack of access to credit cards, last-minute travel plans, or avoiding lines at the station. Clark’s description of his route from Riverton to Lakeview, and the reference to Glendale rather than Riverton, appeared to conflict with the ticket details. Others argued that any confusion or misstatement regarding these locations did not necessarily imply wrongdoing. The timeline also indicates that the train departed Greenvale shortly after the seizure of the bag, meaning Clark had to continue on his journey without it. Whether this was a minor or major inconvenience to Clark, and whether the seizure was justified by the observed circumstances before the train departed, became a central point of controversy.

 Those supporting the Government’s position cite 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) as well as 18 U.S.C. § 2 in underscoring that drug enforcement officers may seize luggage briefly if they have reasonable suspicion of illegal narcotics activity. United States v. Place is invoked to argue that law enforcement needs only a “minimal level of objective justification” to detain the bag to conduct a dog sniff, as long as the officers’ actions are limited and tailored to confirm or dispel their suspicion. They maintain that factors such as paying cash on board, apparent inconsistencies about boarding locations, and the travelers’ behaviors provided a particularized basis for a brief seizure. They also emphasize that, under United States v. Sokolow, even conduct that might be consistent with innocent travel can, in the aggregate, amount to adequate suspicion justifying a short detention of the property.

 Those supporting Clark’s position cite decisions such as United States v. Hall, United States v. Bloom, and United States v. Ward to assert that most of the activities described—like purchasing tickets with cash, traveling one-way, or giving a general rather than precise origin city—are overwhelmingly consistent with lawful travel and do not rise to the level required for a justifiable seizure. They assert that the seizure of Clark’s bag was not supported by enough objective evidence distinct from commonplace travel behaviors, and that the extended retention of the bag (causing Clark to forfeit access to it after the train departed) demanded a higher showing of probable cause rather than mere reasonable suspicion. Clark’s supporters argue further that holding and transporting the bag away from Clark for the dog sniff exceeded the permissible scope of an investigative detention under United States v. Place, contending that the intrusion on Clark’s possessory interest could not be justified on the slender factual basis offered by the officers.
