You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Andrews is an individual who had previously been convicted of a classified offense in New Jersey and was later deported from the United States. When Andrews was deported, he was handed multiple documents by agents of a federal immigration agency, including a form that mistakenly indicated that any unlawful return without permission could lead to a maximum prison term of two years. Andrews acknowledges receiving that form and signing it. Subsequently, Andrews reentered the United States without obtaining the required governmental approval.

 After reentering, Andrews was arrested in City B, Pennsylvania, during a routine encounter detected by local officers. Upon investigation, he was found to be the same person who was previously deported under several different aliases, including Michael Ray, Terrance Gray, Thomas Greene, and Dennis Fox. Fingerprint comparisons from local policing units and Agency B helped confirm that all these names pointed to the same individual, Andrews. On learning that Andrews had returned without permission, federal authorities sought to subject Andrews to criminal penalties provided under 8 U.S.C. § 1326.

 The dispute includes whether the prior deportation order, which was processed under what Andrews contends was a flawed administrative procedure, could constitutionally serve as the basis for this new proceeding. In particular, Andrews alleges that the immigration hearing leading to the original deportation lacked required formalities, pointing out that the proceeding was conducted telephonically and that the adjudicator may not have seen the original conviction record. Andrews also asserts that the misleading information on the form—implying the maximum possible prison sentence was two years—precluded any sentence above that period. The Government, by contrast, emphasizes that the relevant statute unambiguously sets out the possibility of a significantly higher term of imprisonment for such unlawful reentry.

 In support of its position, the Government relies on 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), which explicitly prescribes up to 15 years’ imprisonment for unlawful return by someone who has been deported following an aggravated offense. It stresses that statutory clarity itself suffices to provide constitutional notice of potential penalties. The Government underscores that actual reliance on agency forms is unnecessary when the precise criminal conduct and punishment are clearly set forth in the governing statute. Furthermore, the Government contends that longstanding precedent holds that the text of the statute, rather than informal warnings or advisories, is what individuals must look to in determining the legal consequences of their acts. It also points out that neither the rule of lenity nor due process jurisprudence, embodied in cases interpreting federal criminal statutes, compels limiting a penalty merely because an agency form misstated a law’s effect. Finally, the Government argues that the deportation hearing could validly serve as the predicate for the new charge, given that the alleged administrative failings did not, in the Government’s view, rise to a level that would negate the basic due process protections afforded to Andrews at the time.

 Andrews, for his part, insists that due process and fair notice principles forbid imposing a longer sentence where an official form plainly stated that any reentry without authorization would yield a maximum of two years in prison. Andrews maintains that, by distributing a document with a specific penalty range, the Government effectively assured deportees that this was the limit of punishment for subsequent unlawful reentry. He contends that such government-created expectations are particularly salient in light of the coercive context under which the form was provided—during a deportation process overseen by federal agents—thereby undermining the usual presumption that the individual must locate and interpret the statute without assistance. Andrews further argues that prohibiting a sentence beyond two years aligns with core fairness rationales that run through practice and precedent, including rulings emphasizing the need for unambiguous prosecutorial assurances before imposing extended penalties. Finally, Andrews contends that the underlying deportation hearing was constitutionally inadequate, casting doubt on whether it could serve as a valid foundation for a new criminal charge at all.
