You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Chris Adams was incarcerated at Smithville Correctional Center. Officers employed by the Missouri Department of Corrections, including Pat Jordan (who chaired a disciplinary hearing committee), charged Chris Adams with providing false information to another officer, Mark Davis. Chris Adams denied the accusation, maintaining that he had been in the facility’s gym rather than in the yard at the time in question. A disciplinary hearing ensued shortly thereafter.

 The disciplinary hearing occurred over two days. During this proceeding, Chris Adams attempted to introduce a recreation equipment sign-out sheet from the gym to show that he was not in the prison yard. Pat Jordan called a recess and contacted Officer Miller, another officer familiar with the sign-out procedure, to learn more about this document. Although the stated purpose of this contact was to check the document’s authenticity, the original sign-out sheet was not viewed by the committee members themselves. Chris Adams had also requested that certain witnesses corroborate his account, but different witnesses appeared at the hearing instead.

 As a result of the disciplinary decision, Chris Adams was placed in a Tier II restricted unit. According to the Missouri Department of Corrections staff, the length of his stay in this unit was tied to subsequent behavior and additional conduct violations. Chris Adams later filed a grievance based on what he believed were violations of his procedural rights. When prison officials denied his grievance, Chris Adams pursued relief through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that these events violated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

 In supporting Harper Brown’s position, legal arguments emphasize the deference courts typically grant to prison officials to maintain safety and order. Authorities point to Wolff v. McDonnell for the principle that disciplinary proceedings within prisons serve important institutional goals. This position notes that inmates are not entitled to the full panoply of procedural safeguards found in regular judicial proceedings. Harper Brown’s arguments underscore that the relevant officials attempted to verify the accuracy of Chris Adams’s alibi document and acted reasonably to determine whether it was reliable. Reliance is placed on the idea that no substantial or specific personal bias was shown, and partial limitations on witnesses or evidence can be justified by valid security and administrative concerns.

 In supporting Chris Adams’s position, legal arguments rely on due process principles from Wolff v. McDonnell, emphasizing the inmate’s right to call witnesses, present documentary evidence, and receive a hearing before an impartial decision-maker. Chris Adams’s challenge centers on the claim that Pat Jordan assumed an investigative role during a pause in the hearing and gathered information outside the formal process. Referencing recognized procedures that mandate separation of investigative and adjudicatory roles, these arguments stress the importance of ensuring no individual with a personal stake, direct involvement, or investigative function sits on the disciplinary board. Chris Adams’s position also highlights that the sign-out sheet was never admitted or reviewed by the entire committee, and that the originally requested witnesses were not heard, thereby undermining fundamental fairness mandated by the Constitution.
