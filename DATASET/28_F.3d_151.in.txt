You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Arlo Morgan was prosecuted after pleading guilty to possession of a specified amount of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. He was nineteen years old at the time of the offense. Before this prosecution, he had entered into a plea agreement under which he acknowledged having possessed the controlled substance. In exchange, the Government dropped two other related charges. The applicable sentencing provisions included a mandatory minimum term and set a range that could extend to life. During sentencing, the court reviewed Morgan’s past record and determined his criminal history category based on guidelines that took into account both juvenile and adult offenses.

 As a teenager, Morgan committed several offenses in Fordham District, each of which was handled within the local delinquency system. In that jurisdiction, a juvenile disposition is formally treated as distinct from an adult criminal conviction, but the local code also expressly permits courts to consider juvenile adjudications when determining an appropriate sentence for an adult offense. A central dispute arose because nine of Morgan’s ten criminal history points were attributed to his juvenile record; those juvenile matters involved dispositions that led to extended stays in a facility known here as Riverview Youth Center, a secure commitment center. The overall length of those stays was considered in the same manner as adult incarceration would have been under the sentencing guidelines.

 During sentencing, Morgan requested a downward departure because nearly all his prior points stemmed from juvenile dispositions. He maintained that juvenile confinement, which can be imposed for rehabilitative rather than punitive reasons, should not be equated with adult imprisonment. Additionally, Morgan argued that the guidelines in question were not fully neutral with respect to socio-economic status and race, stressing that he believed discretion in the juvenile system sometimes resulted in disparate outcomes. The Government took the position that the guidelines properly recognized recidivism as a relevant consideration, and that whether a person reoffended as a juvenile or as an adult was a rational factor when deciding upon a criminal history category.

 Arguments supporting the Government focused on statutory provisions in the United States Code that direct the development of sentencing guidelines conducting a comprehensive assessment of “criminal history.” Citing 28 U.S.C. § 994(d)(10), it was emphasized that the Sentencing Commission had broad discretion to evaluate a defendant’s past wrongdoing, including offenses committed as a juvenile. Proponents relied on existing precedent to show that it is longstanding practice for sentencing courts to consider juvenile misconduct in determining the likelihood of recidivism. They further maintained that any difference in terminology between juvenile adjudications and adult convictions does not necessarily control how offenses should be weighed for sentencing purposes. According to this view, the Commission was within its mandate when it aimed to hold individuals with a pattern of lawbreaking more accountable, regardless of whether the defendant had been subject to rehabilitative measures or incarceration during youth. They stressed that the relevant code provisions and guidelines were textually and historically consistent with taking juvenile adjudications into account, and that such an approach served the legitimate goals of deterrence and punishment for repeat offenders.

 Arguments supporting Arlo Morgan focused on the unique character of juvenile proceedings, highlighting that they often emphasize treatment over punishment. Advocates contended that equating juvenile confinement with adult incarceration is misguided because a juvenile sentence may be imposed for a wide range of offender-specific reasons, including the need for special services or a problematic home environment, not simply the severity of the offense. They noted that juvenile adjudications may occur without a jury trial, relying wholly on a judge’s discretion, and that juvenile court dispositions can extend far beyond what would be proportionate in an adult setting for similar conduct. Challenges were also raised about the guidelines’ absolute treatment of all juvenile confinements when Morgan’s history might not reliably prove greater culpability or a higher risk of recidivism. Lastly, they argued that the sentencing scheme risked magnifying socio-economic and racial disparities present in the juvenile system, which could lead to systematically harsher outcomes for people sharing Morgan’s background.
