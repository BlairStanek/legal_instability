You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In the summer of 1992, Jordan Lewis allegedly entered the same branch of Central Reserve Bank of Indiana in Mason, Indiana, on two different dates. On each occasion, he presented a note instructing a teller to hand over money and not to raise an alarm. Although he allegedly kept one hand in his pocket to suggest a weapon, no actual weapon was observed either time. He purportedly collected cash from each teller and left without further incident. According to statements in the record, he later used some of the money to buy an airline ticket to Florida and, on a separate occasion, to purchase a used car.

 After those two incidents, Jordan Lewis was seen entering the same bank on a third occasion. At that point, the same two tellers from the earlier incidents recognized him. A hold-up alarm was triggered, and officers from the Gary Police Department arrived. A responding officer, David Martin, searched Lewis and found a small, scribbled note in his pocket, which apparently bore no resemblance to the notes from the two prior robberies. Following his arrest, Jordan Lewis was interviewed by agents of the FBI and signed a statement confessing to the two earlier robberies. He nevertheless later pleaded not guilty. During the subsequent trial, conflicting accounts arose about exactly what note, if any, Lewis had during his arrest, and a stipulation was read to the jury in an effort to clarify that confusion.

 After the jury returned verdicts against him, Jordan Lewis faced further questions at sentencing based on an alleged attempt to escape custody. On the day of his arrest, officials at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Kingston, Illinois, reported that he was discovered standing on the toilet in his cell, with his head pushed through a displaced portion of the ceiling. This led to a claim that he was attempting to flee. However, because the incident appeared unusual, questions arose as to whether he could realistically have thought an escape of that nature was feasible or whether other motives might explain his actions. It was also noted that Jordan Lewis had undergone psychological evaluation at a federal medical facility in Raymond, Missouri, which found him competent to stand trial and concluded that he was not suffering from a mental defect or suicidal impulses.

 One side has contended that Jordan Lewis’s admissions and other evidence clearly tie him to the two robberies, and that evidence of sizable cash purchases soon after each alleged offense further underscores his participation. This side places significant weight on the signed confession and points to the testimony of the bank tellers who identified him as the person who handed them the written demands. In their view, his conduct upon arrest in the correctional facility—standing with his head in the ceiling—should be understood as a willful effort to evade custody, thereby justifying the application of an enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines § 3C1.1. They note that this section specifically mentions escaping or attempting to escape from custody before trial or sentencing as conduct that may give rise to an increase in offense level. Citing the guideline’s language that stresses a willful obstruction, they argue that, given that nothing in the presented record suggests he was incapable of voluntary choice, his behavior can be interpreted as an intentional plan to reopen or circumvent the ongoing prosecution.

 Another side has insisted that there is insufficient reliable proof that Jordan Lewis acted with the necessary intent to obstruct justice. They emphasize that the only strong indication of an attempted escape comes from an incident report describing him pushing up into the ceiling, which they argue is hardly conclusive evidence of a willful attempt to flee. These arguments highlight that the psychological testing, while showing him competent, might not exclude that he could have acted irrationally or even out of despair, and that no direct witness testimony was introduced from the guard who made the discovery. They further assert that hearsay accounts of the incident do not establish beyond a reasonable inference that Lewis’s actions were a deliberate effort to thwart the investigation or prosecution. Arguing that conscious intent is a core requirement under § 3C1.1, they maintain that the record fails to confirm the requisite mental element for a willful obstruction.
