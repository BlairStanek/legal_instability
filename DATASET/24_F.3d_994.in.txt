You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Between August 14 and December 28 of a single year, Martin Reynolds carried out five robberies in the state of Wisconsin. In each instance, he approached a teller at a financial institution—such as Meadowvale Bank, Riverbridge Bank, Oak Grove Credit Union, or Woodmere Bank—and demanded money. Leslie Carter later became the opposing party in litigation concerning these events.

 Martin Reynolds used written notes and specific gestures during the robberies. On one occasion, he handed a teller a note stating, “Give me all your money right away,” while resting his hand, concealed in a coat pocket, on the counter. On another, his note read, “This is a robbery, I have a gun, give me your money, don’t try anything foolish,” again with a hand hidden in a jacket pocket. Several of these incidents involved notes indicating “I have a gun,” sometimes accompanied by statements such as “No tricks, I’m watching,” and repeatedly featuring a concealed hand pointed toward the teller. He ultimately pleaded guilty to five counts of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a).

 After Martin Reynolds’s guilty plea, there was a dispute regarding whether his actions and words—telling the tellers he had a gun and pointing a concealed hand—constituted an “express threat of death” under U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). Leslie Carter contended that some combination of Reynolds’s notes, statements, and body language invoked heightened fear. Martin Reynolds, however, argued that while he claimed to have a gun, the statements and gestures did not necessarily imply a threat of fatal harm.

 In support of Leslie Carter’s position, it was argued that Reynolds’s words and gestures rose to a level of severity that an ordinary person could perceive as a direct threat of being killed if demands were not met. Various authorities—including the text of U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) and commentary illustrating that an “act, gesture, or combination thereof” can qualify—were cited to underscore that pointing a concealed hand toward a teller while insisting “I have a gun” naturally communicates grave danger. Such arguments also relied on examples from cases like United States v. Smith, emphasizing that the combination of claiming to possess a firearm and using body language to simulate its use could be read as sufficiently direct to constitute an express threat of death. Additional references were made to underlying legal principles, which note that creating a fear of being shot surpasses the basic element of fear necessary for robbery and thus warrants a heightened response under the sentencing framework.

 In support of Martin Reynolds’s position, it was emphasized that simply claiming to have a gun, or mouthing words along those lines, does not automatically equate to a clear, explicit threat to kill. Drawing on decisions such as United States v. Canzater and United States v. Moore, the contention was that a statement such as “I have a gun” is more akin to an implied threat aimed at inducing fear or compliance, rather than an outright promise of death. Further, it was proposed that since the commentary to U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) contains examples specifically referencing “I will kill you” or “Give me the money or you are dead,” the guidelines contemplated more definitive language than what Reynolds employed, and that punishing a mere implied threat like a direct vow of lethal harm would blur the distinction the guidelines seek to preserve.
