You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The Lanceton Education District is located in Arkansas and encompasses the City of Lanceton and nearby rural areas. According to the 1980 federal census, the District’s total population was about 23,500, with around 64% identifying as white and 35% identifying as Black; among the voting-age population of about 14,500, approximately 70% were white and 29% were Black. The Black population in the District primarily resides in the southern section of the City of Lanceton and has been described as politically cohesive. The governing body, called the Board, has eight members who each serve four-year terms, with two seats up for election annually.

 For years, Board candidates were elected by whoever received the highest number of votes, whether or not that candidate had a majority. In 1987, a state statute changed the process to a majority-vote requirement, meaning that if no candidate won over fifty percent of the votes in the initial round, a runoff would occur between the top two vote-getters. Melinda Jackson and several other Black voters challenged this shift, contending that it adversely affected the ability of Black citizens to elect preferred candidates. In the past, at least one Black member had served on the Board since the mid-1970s, and at times two Black members served concurrently. Some of these members won as incumbents or were elected through bullet voting, and multiple elections involved both contested and uncontested races. After 1987, there were concerns among a portion of the electorate about whether Black candidates could still succeed under the new rules.

 Melinda Jackson herself ran unsuccessfully in multiple elections after the majority-vote system took effect, as did another candidate named Donna Kingsley. Some observers explained these losses as a result of low voter turnout among Black voters in post-1987 elections, while others suggested that the Black candidates might simply have been less appealing to voters broadly. The Lanceton Education District disagreed with claims that the change to a majority-vote system fundamentally undermined the Black community’s electoral chances, pointing out that at least one Black incumbent ran without opposition after 1987 and continued to serve. A related dispute arose over a request for attorneys’ fees, and both sides took firm positions on whether the other side’s legal approach warranted any sanctions.

 In support of Melinda Jackson, it was asserted that the majority-vote requirement particularly disadvantaged minority voters, pointing to Thornburg v. Gingles and arguing that a more cohesive white voting bloc could more easily defeat Black candidates in runoff scenarios than in the earlier plurality system. Proponents of Jackson’s position highlighted the historical patterns of discrimination against Black citizens, the lower socioeconomic indicators of Black residents, and the significantly polarized voting that appeared along racial lines. They emphasized that after the switch to a majority-vote system, few, if any, non-incumbent Black candidates achieved electoral success. They argued that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires not only an equal chance to cast a ballot but also a realistic opportunity to elect candidates of choice—something they claimed was curbed by the runoff requirement when only 29% of the voting-age population was Black. They pointed to the Senate factors described in Thornburg v. Gingles, including the past discrimination in voting practices, the continuing socio-economic disparities, and racially polarized campaigning as bolstering the contention that this change in the election process effectively diluted Black voting strength.

 On behalf of the Lanceton Education District, it was argued that Black voters had achieved consistent representation, evidenced by the fact that at least one Black member had long served on the Board and that there were years when two Black members held seats simultaneously. These supporters maintained that the mere existence of a runoff format did not necessarily deprive the Black community of an opportunity to elect preferred candidates. They noted that certain Black candidates in the past had secured broad support, including from white voters, undermining the suggestion of a consistently impenetrable racial bloc. Additionally, they highlighted the importance of distinguishing between mere voter apathy and intentional disenfranchisement, suggesting that the drop in participation among Black voters might reflect a variety of factors unrelated to the majority-vote requirement. They further cited legal precedent suggesting that past electoral successes by Black candidates indicated that the at-large system was not inherently discriminatory under Section 2, particularly given that incumbents consistently kept their seats and new Black candidates had never been foreclosed from running.
