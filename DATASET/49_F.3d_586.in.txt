You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Washington enacted a statute, RCW 9A.36.060, that makes it a Class C felony for anyone to “knowingly cause or aid another person to attempt suicide.” Kindness for Final Days, a nonprofit organization formed in Washington, was established to support individuals described by its members as terminally ill and mentally competent in hastening their deaths, though it does not itself administer lethal medication. Several individuals joined Kindness for Final Days in challenging the statute. These included three terminally ill patients (Patricia Green, Michael Brown, and David Wright) who sought information and possible physician assistance to end their suffering. Each of these three individuals died during the course of the proceedings. Four physicians (Samuel Phillips, Maria Johnson, Andrew Hall, and Charles Smith) also participated, stating that they occasionally treated terminally ill patients who asked for help in ending their lives.

 Patricia Green suffered from cancer and had been bedridden for many months; Michael Brown, an artist living with partial blindness, was also diagnosed with a disease termed incurable; and David Wright had advanced lung disease, requiring constant oxygen support. Each of them expressed a desire not to endure a prolonged and painful dying process, and they joined the lawsuit to seek legal relief that might enable them to obtain medical assistance in hastening death. In turn, Samuel Phillips specialized in cancer care, Maria Johnson directed a family practice in Lakeview and taught at Midland Academy of Medicine, Andrew Hall headed a cardiology department at Harbor Medical Facility and also served as a professor at Midland Academy of Medicine, and Charles Smith directed the Lakeview Outreach Clinic and maintained a private practice in Lakeview. They each declared that, from time to time, they encountered terminally ill patients whose suffering might be alleviated more directly if they could assist in a hastened death, but they refrained because of the statute. Kindness for Final Days contended that enforcing RCW 9A.36.060 prevented open conversations with dying patients who were considering such an option.

 The dispute arose when Kindness for Final Days, together with these individual patients and physicians, initiated litigation in the district court, contending that the statute impermissibly burdened rights protected under the Constitution. Although Patricia Green, Michael Brown, and David Wright did not survive to see any final resolution of the claims, the doctors and the nonprofit organization continued to press the case. According to the plaintiffs, Washington law did permit withholding or withdrawing life-support measures for certain individuals, yet did not allow other dying patients to seek additional means of hastening death. Washington maintained that the challenged statute served vital public interests and that no right existed to obtain active physician help in accelerating the end of life.

 Arguments supporting Washington’s position focused on several overlapping interests. First, it was contended that the state has a longstanding commitment to preserving human life and protecting vulnerable individuals, and that outlawing assistance in suicide is a direct way to fulfill that responsibility. Supporters of the statute pointed to the historical role of medical professionals as healers, arguing that permitting them to assist in hastening death could erode public trust in the medical profession. They also cited concerns that elderly, indigent, or disabled persons might feel financial or societal pressure to end their lives prematurely if physician-assisted measures were allowed. Further, they noted that the statute is consistent with many traditional legal principles that prohibit one person from intentionally ending another’s life, even upon request. In addition, those defending the statute argued that the law is rationally based in the wider tapestry of tort and criminal jurisprudence by preventing harm and potential abuses, and by averting any drift toward non-voluntary or coerced endings of life. In support of these contentions, reference was made to legal commentary, to various commissions in different states examining end-of-life practices, and to codes of professional conduct—such as those by the National Medical Society—emphasizing that a physician’s primary role is the care and treatment of patients rather than participation in causing death.

 Arguments supporting Kindness for Final Days and the individuals who wished to hasten death turned on constitutional guarantees of privacy, liberty, and equal treatment under the law. Proponents of that view asserted that certain personal decisions are so intimate and fundamental that no state may interfere with them unless the state has a compelling interest, demanding that any restriction be narrowly drawn. They reasoned that the choice to shorten a terminally ill and painful dying process is an essential aspect of personhood, autonomy, and dignity—akin to other important personal decisions recognized as private. Citing precedents addressing the right to refuse medical treatment, they contended that it is inconsistent to allow some terminally ill persons to end prolonged suffering by refusing life-support measures while denying the same opportunity to other similarly situated individuals whose conditions are no less final or burdensome. They argued that Washington’s interest in preserving life should be contextualized by the reality that these patients had a short life expectancy, that the state’s interest necessarily weakens when death is near, and that regulations can be drawn to safeguard against abuses without entirely barring a physician from offering medically supervised assistance. References were made to decisions recognizing an individual’s liberty to control end-of-life care, as well as to scholarly discussion of how the Constitution’s provisions regarding personal autonomy and equal protection might apply to terminally ill adults seeking a medically assisted end to their suffering.
