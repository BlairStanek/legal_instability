You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


David Irving was charged with conspiracy and with using extortionate means to attempt to collect a loan. The Government alleged that these acts arose from a longstanding pattern of family involvement in racketeering and loansharking. David Irving’s father, Daniel Irving, had earlier been indicted, placed under house arrest, and reportedly suffered health problems, at which point David Irving became more active in the collection of debts.  

 The Government presented evidence that David Irving tried to collect on a loan originally extended by Daniel Irving to an individual named Juan Adar. This loan had a high interest rate, and when Adar stopped making payments, David Irving put pressure on him to pay in full. Recordings were introduced that seemed to depict threats, and there was also testimony about an alleged break-in at Adar’s home, during which Adar’s children were present. Meanwhile, David Irving had a prior burglary conviction dating back to 1980. At sentencing for the extortion conviction, David Irving contested the use of that earlier burglary conviction to categorize him as a career offender.

 During his trial, an indictment against Daniel Irving was admitted into evidence. That indictment detailed multiple alleged instances of loansharking activities involving Daniel Irving. There were also questions posed to David Irving about whether he knew of his father’s alleged extortionate activities. David Irving claimed that, although he pressed Adar to satisfy the debt, he was not part of any broader criminal endeavor. He also introduced material in an effort to explain his actions, including references to a difficult childhood history.

 For its position, the Government’s main arguments relied on the principle that criminal sentences may properly account for past convictions under established sentencing guidelines. It emphasized that any broad challenge to prior judgments should be handled through the traditional avenues and only in limited circumstances during sentencing. The Government also cited decisions indicating that not all older convictions are open to collateral attack in the context of a new sentencing procedure, especially where they are facially valid or do not implicate fundamental structural errors. It further argued that evidence of the family’s background was admitted because it directly explained motive, intent, and context in the extortion case, and that relevant criminal history—even if not formally counted for points—could still reflect overall culpability under guidelines and established case law.

 David Irving’s arguments rested on the notion that defendants must have the right to challenge constitutionally infirm convictions at every stage if those convictions enhance punishment. He drew attention to precedent that suggests a heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted for prior judgments used to increase a sentence. He claimed that his 1980 burglary conviction was unconstitutionally obtained and should therefore be disregarded under constitutional and statutory doctrines which prohibit the use of convictions tainted by inadequate counsel. Additionally, David Irving maintained that the introduction of the lengthy indictment against Daniel Irving unfairly associated him with alleged acts in which he played no part, creating a risk of improper prejudice that outweighed any probative value under evidence rules.
