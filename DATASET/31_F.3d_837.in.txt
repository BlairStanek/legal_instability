You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Peak Standard Enterprises, doing business as Peak Standard Manufacturing, went into default on a financing agreement with Cliffside Financial Services, doing business as Corporate Lending Services. Afterward, Cliffside Financial Services took possession of Peak Standard Enterprises’ assets and formed Cliffside Manufacturing, Inc. to continue operations. During this restructuring, Jordan Abel assumed the role of president and board chair of Cliffside Manufacturing.

 Under the new finance arrangement, monetary inflows to Cliffside Manufacturing were directed to Cliffside Financial Services, which then returned only a portion of these funds to Cliffside Manufacturing. The partial funds were used primarily for employee payroll rather than federal employment tax obligations. It is uncontested that Jordan Abel knew there were unpaid federal employment taxes and that he discussed these delinquencies with another individual at Cliffside Financial Services, who indicated the taxes would be handled at a later date.

 Over time, Jordan Abel maintained various executive duties at Cliffside Manufacturing, including hiring and firing employees, setting their compensation, and signing both payroll checks and contracts. In addition, Jordan Abel prepared and signed corporate tax returns. From the Government’s perspective, these actions signaled an ability to exercise control over the finances that would allow payment of the tax liabilities. Jordan Abel, however, contended that the finance structure with Cliffside Financial Services restricted him from doing so fully, and that decisions regarding which bills to pay rested elsewhere.

 In support of Jordan Abel’s position, legal arguments highlight that 26 U.S.C. § 6672 imposes liability only on “responsible” individuals who “willfully” fail to pay trust fund taxes. Authorities emphasize the need for actual authority and significant financial control over corporate operations. Proponents of Jordan Abel’s view apply case law requiring a “final word” in disbursements as a hallmark of responsibility. They argue that he lacked the discretionary ability to direct payments toward withheld taxes. Given that his authority was allegedly curtailed through the finance agreement and that he was following directions from others who promised to remediate the unpaid taxes, supporters of this side assert he lacked the requisite control or willfulness to incur personal liability under the statute.

 In support of the Government’s position, legal arguments rely on similar statutory and case precedents emphasizing that responsibility includes the power to sign checks, decide the order of payments, and manage payroll. They note that turning to other creditors or expenses before paying withheld taxes is generally viewed as a “voluntary, conscious, and intentional” preference of creditors over the United States. Case law cited in this line of reasoning advises that persons with direct control over corporate finances have a duty to appropriate available funds toward these trust fund obligations. Hence, according to this view, having the power to sign checks and the authority to manage day-to-day operations, even under some constraints, indicates that Jordan Abel bore sufficient responsibility and acted willfully if he intentionally paid other creditors or employees before satisfying tax liabilities.
