You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Patton was stopped and cited for driving under the influence after officials had arrived at a residence to arrest another individual, Laurel. According to Patton, two officials involved in Laurel’s arrest had asked Patton to drive behind them so he could transport a witness back home. Partway through the process, a third official pulled Patton over, leading to his citation. Patton’s counsel sought information regarding the two officials plus their prior accounts, but the prosecution withheld that information until just before trial. Patton moved to exclude evidence of his driving and demeanor, and the trial court—citing the prosecution’s failure to disclose—excluded the evidence and dismissed the case without prejudice.

 The prosecution appealed that dismissal to the state supreme court. Patton argued that the trial court’s dismissal was justified because any statements by the two officials could be exculpatory, given they allegedly allowed him to drive if they believed he was sober. Meanwhile, the prosecution maintained that the withheld material might not be exculpatory and that the trial court should have reviewed it before imposing a dismissal. The state supreme court ultimately concluded that the lower court was required to inspect the relevant report and consider alternative remedies, such as allowing Patton time to review any exculpatory evidence, before dismissing.

 Patton then pursued a further appeal, contending that the possibility of a constitutional issue under Brady v. Maryland existed because he believed the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence. The prosecution countered that if the materials were not exculpatory, then no constitutional issue had matured. Some arguments also involved whether the state supreme court should have exercised jurisdiction at that point, given that the dismissal was without prejudice. Additionally, the record reflected that a significant amount of time had passed since the original citation, highlighting concerns about the efficiency of repeated appellate steps without a definitive ruling on whether the undisclosed information was truly exculpatory.

 For the Commonwealth’s position, one key argument is that a potential Brady v. Maryland question allows for federal review of Patton’s claims, as such a question raises constitutional considerations under the Due Process Clause. The Commonwealth also asserts that it had a legitimate right to appeal the dismissal under local rules, and that the state supreme court properly used the authority granted to it by statute to demand a closer look at the allegedly withheld evidence. Moreover, the Commonwealth contends that the trial court should have performed an in camera inspection rather than resorting prematurely to dismissal, thereby balancing local procedural rules with the constitutional requirement to disclose potentially exculpatory information.

 For Patton’s position, a central argument is that the circumstances appear to implicate Brady v. Maryland because the two officials supposedly instructed him to drive, suggesting that what they observed could be directly relevant to whether he was intoxicated. Patton maintains that once he requested anything exculpatory, constitutional obligations required prompt disclosure, without the added necessity of further motions or prolonged judicial review. Patton also notes that the finality of the dismissal was sufficiently clear from his perspective, because the trial court issued an order ending the prosecution over the prosecution’s lack of compliance. Furthermore, Patton argues that without conclusive proof of what the withheld evidence actually said, the delay in his case prevents a swift resolution of whether his due process rights were infringed.
