You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Joseph Brown is an official at the Federal Correctional Institute (FCI) in Faircrest, California. Grant Thomson was held there as a pretrial detainee. On a particular day, FCI personnel required Grant Thomson to provide a urine sample, which tested positive for illegal substances. A written incident report was issued reflecting this result. Thomson contested the report using the grievance and review system established within the federal prison.

 Two disciplinary hearings followed. At the second hearing, Thomson had the opportunity to attend and present arguments, though he did not call any witnesses. The hearing official concluded that the positive test result was valid. Thomson was put in segregated confinement for sixty days as a sanction. Thomson then pursued the prison system’s multi-step appeals process, sending a form to the appropriate regional authority, which denied his appeal. He next attempted to direct an appeal to the General Counsel’s Office. Questions arose about whether that final appeal was submitted on time and whether its receipt was properly documented.

 Thomson later sought judicial review, arguing that assigned deadlines within the prison’s grievance system were difficult to meet. He says that he faced various obstacles, including alleged irregularities in obtaining the final appeal form and restricted law library access. Thomson further maintained that an unfavorable result could negatively affect his eventual parole or other release possibilities. No formal finding of lost good time credits was made, though Thomson insisted that a disciplinary record could still have potential future consequences.

 In support of Joseph Brown’s position, there is an argument relying on federal regulations that specify when an appeal is considered “filed” in the administrative process. The regulations define the point of “filing” as the date a receipt is issued, and this approach is seen as consistent with the text of those provisions. The argument contends that allowing a different rule, such as a mailbox rule, would be inconsistent with these specific administrative requirements. Additionally, it is argued that an inmate facing any legitimate delay has the option to request more time within the same prison process, so adopting a mailbox rule is unnecessary. Key authorities invoked include the relevant provisions in Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which clarify the steps and timing of appeals. By pointing out that an inmate may secure extensions of time for valid reasons, this position emphasizes that there is no need to read extra flexibility into the clearly stated filing requirement.

 In support of Grant Thomson’s position, there is an argument that the same fairness concerns recognized in certain court filings should also apply in this prison setting. He draws on the rationale from decisions discussing the mailbox rule for incarcerated persons, pointing out that individuals in custody typically must rely on prison staff to process mail and have no other way to ensure timely delivery of legal paperwork. The view is that, without a liberal construction of filing deadlines, a prisoner could be unfairly disadvantaged if delays occur through no fault of the prisoner. Citing well-known precedent emphasizing pro se prisoners’ unique challenges, Thomson argues that the spirit of equal access principles suggests that delivering appeal documents to prison officials on or before a due date should count as timely. He also maintains that, even if the existing regulations define “filed” in a narrow manner, those provisions could reasonably accommodate this broader reading so that the prisoner’s ability to press an appeal is not undermined by logistical barriers.
