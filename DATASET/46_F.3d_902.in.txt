You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Argento was born in Riverdale, Lithuania, in 1964, during a period when the Soviet Union exerted control. His father was deemed a dissident and served time in Soviet labor camps, where he died in 1975. Argento’s family practiced religion, and Argento himself resisted participation in Communist Party activities. According to Argento’s account, his teachers and peers in Lithuania subjected him to harassment and ostracism because of his religious stance, and he was prevented from attending a university.

 Argento entered the United States in 1980 at the age of sixteen. Soon after, he began experiencing alcohol-related difficulties and was convicted in 1983 of burglary on two occasions. In 1984, Argento’s mother was granted asylum, but Argento did not attend the hearing that could have led to his obtaining the same status. After resolving his alcohol issues, Argento secured a steady job and contributed financially to his mother’s expenses.

 The INS initiated deportation proceedings against Argento, citing both Argento’s visa overstay and his earlier criminal convictions. Argento conceded deportability but applied for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) and also sought temporary withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. § 1253(h). As part of these proceedings, Argento presented evidence that he was harassed by school officials. He also stated that his parents had periodically been placed under house arrest for political reasons while living in Lithuania. Although some reports from the Northern Region (formerly referred to as the Baltic Republics) noted significant alterations in governance after the Soviet era, Argento claimed that he retained a fear of facing harm upon return to Lithuania.

 One position taken in the case cites Argento’s visa overstay and convictions to support denying immigration relief. Proponents of this view rely on the assertion that a person seeking protection under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) must either show past harm that meets a high standard or demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). Under decisions such as INS v. Stevic and Matter of Chen, it is argued that an individual’s eligibility for relief also involves weighing the likelihood of present or future persecution in light of intervening changes in the home country’s political and social structures. According to this position, the improvements in Lithuania, coupled with the absence of any contemporary evidence of targeting Argento, undermine the claim of a serious risk of future persecution. Additionally, certain arguments underscore that considerations such as repeated lawful violations in the United States might militate against granting relief in a discretionary evaluation.

 Another position emphasizes Argento’s background, notably religious harassment in his school years, his father’s dissident status, and the family’s reported subjection to house arrest by Soviet authorities. Relying on precedent such as Desir v. Ilchert, advocates of this view maintain that these experiences align with the statutory definition of a refugee under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). They further point out that courts such as the one in Acewicz v. INS have recognized a viable claim of persecution based on past harm, even if the political climate in the person’s country later shifts. It is contended that Argento’s youth, the effect of Soviet-era oppression on his family, and his mother’s successful asylum claim collectively indicate a history of persecution profound enough to justify relief under existing law. Proponents of this position also contend that magistrates and tribunals must carefully factor in personal rehabilitation and the hardships family members would endure were Argento removed, consistent with the discretionary considerations outlined in Matter of Pula and other decisions.
