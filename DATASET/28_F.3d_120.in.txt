You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Paula Martin Hastings worked for the Agency for International Development and was sent to Westport, Liberia, where she met and later married Terrence Hastings, who was employed by the Liberian Ministry of Justice. Soon after arriving in Westport, she became pregnant, confirmed by a test administered by Dr. Howell, a local physician recommended by Terrence. Afterward, she typically received prenatal care from Dr. Thompson, another local doctor.

 Following the birth of her child, Carlton Hastings, at Bayview Clinic with Dr. Thompson assisting, Paula developed symptoms of illness at home. One evening, Terrence’s friend alerted the local United States Embassy health unit. Because Dr. Norman, the Regional Medical Officer, was unavailable, the Embassy psychiatrist, Dr. Robles, visited Paula with Nurse Morgan. The psychiatrist recommended that Paula consult Dr. Thompson immediately and then see Dr. Norman the following morning. Paula did visit Dr. Norman the next day, who advised her to continue breastfeeding. Shortly afterward, Carlton refused feeding and became lethargic, leading Paula and Terrence to seek treatment first at Bayview Clinic, then at Lakeview Hospital.

 Carlton’s condition worsened when he began experiencing seizures. The family again went to the Embassy health unit where Dr. Norman treated Carlton with antibiotics and called in Dr. Garcia, an American pediatrician practicing locally. After discussing possible evacuation, Dr. Norman and Dr. Garcia arranged for Carlton’s admission to Harvey General Hospital, despite the parents’ concerns about its reported poor conditions. Carlton stayed there overnight, accompanied by Paula and friends, including Dr. Stevens. When his health did not improve, Paula and Terrence insisted on transferring him to Maplewood Hospital, where he remained until he was ultimately flown to Colorado. Carlton was later placed in a long-term care center, and Ruth Martin, Paula’s mother, became his legal guardian. Paula and Ruth Martin sought damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, alleging that Department of State personnel in Washington, D.C., negligently supervised Dr. Norman, contributing to Carlton’s permanent injuries.

 In support of the United States, various theories focus on how the Federal Tort Claims Act conditions liability on acts or omissions by government employees that breach a standard of care recognized by the law of the place where the alleged negligence occurred. Advocates for the United States contend that even if Dr. Norman’s medical decisions were questionable, there was no breach of any supervisory duty under District of Columbia common law principles, such as those applied in cases interpreting Restatement (Second) of Agency § 213. According to these arguments, the mere existence of complaints about a doctor’s attitude or availability does not establish that officials had grounds to question his medical competence, so no closer monitoring was required. Supporters of this position also invoke statutes removing discretion-based acts or foreign-country-related incidents from the scope of potential liability, and underscore precedents like Murphy v. Army Distaff Found., Inc. and Lacy v. District of Columbia addressing the requirements for proving proximate cause. They emphasize that establishing a causal link under the “substantial factor” test from Daniels v. Hadley Memorial Hospital and similar cases requires more than showing dissatisfaction or inconvenience.

 In support of Paula Martin Hastings, the emphasis rests on her claim that the Department of State had specific notice of Dr. Norman’s chronic unavailability and poor attitude, thereby triggering a duty under District of Columbia law to supervise him more effectively. Proponents of her position cite the doctrine of negligent supervision as explained in decisions referencing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 213, maintaining that officials were obligated to respond when numerous complaints indicated that Dr. Norman was allegedly inattentive to urgent medical needs. They argue that closer oversight, reporting requirements, or warnings to the Embassy in Westport would have led to earlier and possibly correct treatment of Carlton’s condition, preventing the devastating outcome. These advocates highlight that the Federal Tort Claims Act allows suits where negligence by government employees contributes to harm. They also draw upon authorities like Morrison v. MacNamara, Daniels v. Hadley Memorial Hospital, and other cases suggesting that when a defendant’s conduct has made it more difficult to determine whether the victim might have had a better outcome, the burden of uncertainty should fall on the negligent actor.
