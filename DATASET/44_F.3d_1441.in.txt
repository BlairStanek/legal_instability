You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Carlos Velez arrived in the United States from Cuba through the Bayline boatlift in 1980. Authorities initially paroled him into the country but later ordered him excluded and deported. Over the years, he was kept in detention because his deportation could not be carried out when Cuba and any other possible destination declined to accept him. He was placed in various correctional facilities, with one short parole period in which he stayed at a supervised halfway house. During detention, he underwent multiple evaluations revealing certain mental health and intellectual challenges.

 Velez’s involvement with law enforcement began soon after his release on parole. He faced several arrests for alleged theft and robbery offenses. Some charges did not lead to convictions, although two armed robbery counts resulted in a guilty plea and a sentence of concurrent jail terms. While detained, he engaged in disruptive incidents, leading to disciplinary infractions. At one point, medical evaluations indicated he had notable social and mental difficulties requiring close supervision and a structured environment.

 The Government, acting through its agencies, subjected Velez to periodic parole reviews under prescribed regulations. These reviews looked into matters such as his criminal history, institutional behavior, mental status, and readiness to reintegrate. The Government highlighted concerns that Velez presented safety risks in community settings, especially following allegations of serious misconduct during his brief parole period. As a result, the Government consistently declined to grant him a lasting release, citing the lack of a feasible deportation destination and the need to protect public safety.

 In support of its position for continued detention, the Government relies on immigration statutes that address exclusion, parole, and deportation procedures. The Government focuses on the language of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226, 1182(d)(5)(A), and 1227(a)(1), arguing that these provisions, read together, confer authority for prolonged detention when deportation remains unfeasible. It contends that the statutory scheme makes parole discretionary, designed only for limited circumstances, and that no explicit time limit restricts custody in the case of an excluded individual who cannot be removed. In addition, the Government highlights cases such as Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, asserting that when an alien is deemed excludable, continuous confinement does not violate constitutional guarantees because the alien, in legal contemplation, has never formally entered the country.

 In support of his position that he should be released, Carlos Velez contends that no specific immigration law grants indefinite authority to detain someone who cannot practically be deported. He invokes principles drawn from United States v. Salerno and Foucha v. Louisiana, maintaining that indefinite confinement is punitive and cannot be imposed in a regulatory context without clearer legislative guidance. Velez argues that the detention has surpassed any reasonable period intended to secure deportation or protect immediate public safety and thus violates due process. He also references older precedents, including Wong Wing v. United States, to note that even excludable persons cannot be held for unduly long periods without stronger justifications grounded in statutory authority and constitutional law.
