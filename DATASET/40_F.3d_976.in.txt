You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


John Baxter was charged with attempting to kill a relative after a confrontation in which he fired shots through the relative’s front door. He claimed that he only intended to scare the relative and aimed when he believed the relative had moved out of harm’s way. John Baxter and his counsel decided not to seek or request instructions on lesser included offenses. The State prosecuted him on the allegation that he intended to commit murder.

 During the trial, the judge instructed the jury to deliberate carefully, to consider each other’s views, and to avoid yielding on sincerely held beliefs. After several hours of deliberation, the jury sent word that it was at an impasse. The judge asked about the number of votes taken and the numerical progression of those votes, which the jury described as shifting from a near-even split to a larger majority on one side. Despite proposals from the State and John Baxter’s counsel to declare a deadlock, the judge had the jury continue deliberating.

 On a subsequent day, the jury again reported an impasse. The judge repeated questions about how many ballots had been taken and about the numerical division of the jury. The jury revealed it had moved further toward a single hold-out position. John Baxter’s counsel expressed concern that continued deliberation could pressure the hold-out juror. The jury then resumed deliberations for a short period. Eventually, it reached a unanimous decision, and John Baxter later challenged the circumstances of the deliberations, contending that the judge’s polling of the jury and encouragement to continue had a coercive effect. The State maintained that the judge’s approach was neutral and within acceptable legal boundaries.

 In support of John Baxter’s position that he should prevail, several arguments focus on constitutional fair-trial protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. These arguments rely in part on case law such as Allen v. United States and Locks v. Sumner, which deal with how judicial instructions and inquiries can affect jury deliberations. They emphasize that polling the jury about its numerical division after an impasse can exert undue pressure on minority jurors if coupled with remarks implying a need to conform to a majority. They also point out that no additional cautionary instruction was given to remind jurors not to abandon sincerely held beliefs merely for the sake of unanimity. By highlighting these factors, John Baxter’s arguments contend that the absence of such an admonition allowed subtle compulsion to influence the final verdict. Citing further references to cases interpreting jury coercion standards, these arguments insist the judge’s actions impermissibly tipped the balance, potentially depriving John Baxter of an impartial jury process.

 In support of the State’s position that it should prevail, several arguments underscore long-standing precedent permitting courts to ask the jury about the feasibility of continued deliberations, as recognized in Locks v. Sumner among other authorities. The State’s position is that measuring whether deliberations have progressed is a neutral step and that encouraging a jury to continue deliberating - even if one juror remains unconvinced - does not by itself create coercion. These arguments note that the instructions initially given reminded jurors not to succumb to majority views if it violated their own judgments, so there was no inherent pressure for the lone hold-out to yield. They contend that cases like Lowenfield v. Phelps support the principle that, as long as the judge’s inquiries or statements do not force the jurors to renounce sincerely held beliefs, urging jurors to keep deliberating is permissible. Thus, the State maintains the trial judge acted within accepted legal limits and safeguarded the rights of all jurors.
