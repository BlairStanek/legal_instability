You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1971, Mary Winston prepared a will establishing a trust that would provide a life interest to her longtime employee, Kevin Fletcher, with any remaining portion going to Elmwood University, a recognized charitable institution. Over the following years—specifically in 1972, 1977, and 1982—Mary Winston executed codicils that adjusted some details regarding Kevin Fletcher’s lifetime benefits. Mary Winston passed away in 1985, leaving Kevin Fletcher, then in his early eighties, as the life beneficiary with certain monthly financial payments and various expenses to be covered by the trust. Elmwood University was named as the charitable remainderman who, under the will, would receive what was left after Kevin Fletcher’s life interest ended.

 After Mary Winston’s death, Harper Bank, as trustee, pursued an estate tax deduction for the charitable remainder left to Elmwood University. Concern arose because the trust provisions allowed for potentially broad payments on behalf of Kevin Fletcher, including coverage of his medical expenses, taxes, upkeep and improvements of a certain residence located in Riverside, California, and other expenditures. These provisions had the potential to reduce unpredictably the trust principal that would ultimately pass to Elmwood University. In 1988, Harper Bank obtained a reformation of the trust in the state court, converting Kevin Fletcher’s interest into a fixed annual amount, in hopes of satisfying tax-code requirements for a charitable deduction.

 The dispute that arose between Harper Bank and the Government then focused on whether the remainder interest was eligible for a charitable deduction under the applicable tax rules. From one perspective, Mary Winston’s 1971 will might qualify for more permissive rules, but questions were raised as to whether a 1982 codicil effectively re-executed the will at a later date—beyond the cutoff for those more permissive rules. Another point of contention was whether Kevin Fletcher’s initial interest was so open-ended, because of unspecified improvements and other expenses, that the value of Elmwood University’s remainder could not be precisely computed at the time of Mary Winston’s death.

 One set of arguments emphasizes that, under 26 U.S.C. § 2055(e)(3) and related provisions, a will or trust may be reformed even after a testator’s death if the original instrument meets the statutory definition of a reformable interest. From this viewpoint, the key is that the will was executed at a time predating certain legal changes, and thus it should be viewed as benefitting from the more lenient rules that governed before January 1979. Arguments here highlight that “execution” of a will, as commonly understood, refers to its original signing, and that “republication” by codicil is not the same event, especially because Congress removed certain language linking codicils to execution. They also stress that a trust may still have a “presently ascertainable” remainder so long as beneficiary expenditures are subject to real-world limiting factors—such as only covering routine improvements necessary to maintain a home, or paying income taxes that can be calculated under standard formulas—and therefore the charitable remainder’s value could be measured using established actuarial principles. Citing doctrines akin to those in Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, the position here is that the trust’s specific obligations on behalf of Kevin Fletcher are no more indefinite than paying for “comfort” within a certain range, which is considered sufficiently quantifiable.

 Another set of arguments contends that the 1982 codicil should be treated, under well-established rules of testamentary law, as republishing the entire will, effectively making the operative date of the will occur post-1979. Those taking this approach rely on principles stating that a codicil that expressly republishes a will re-executes it, unless doing so would frustrate the testator’s primary intent. As a result, they argue, the will might not qualify for any beneficial treatment applicable to instruments executed before the cutoff because of the later date of republication. Moreover, regarding whether the charitable remainder is “presently ascertainable,” the argument is that covering unstated amounts of improvements, renovations, or taxes due from Kevin Fletcher—especially if they include income taxes on outside earnings or potentially wide-ranging home modifications—introduces uncertainties that are too broad to compute reliably. Citing the requirement that a remainder’s value not hinge on open-ended expenditures or purely discretionary satisfactions, these arguments point to precedents disallowing charitable deductions where the beneficiary can invade principal in unpredictable ways, making the charitable share too indefinite for precise valuation.
