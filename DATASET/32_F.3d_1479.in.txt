You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Lee Davis was charged under three federal statutes in connection with traveling by automobile from the State of Washington to the State of Utah. The charges involved purportedly transporting two individuals—one an adult companion, the other a 13-year-old (identified here as E.Q.)—with the alleged intention that the adult companion and E.Q. engage in prostitution. Lee Davis faced three counts: one involved the adult companion, and two involved E.Q. During the trial, the jury deliberated and reached a result on only one of the counts initially, then later announced verdicts on the remaining counts.

 When the jury was about to deliver its verdicts, one juror (identified here as D.B.) became visibly upset just before entering the courtroom. The marshal in charge, Samuel Kendall, saw D.B. crying and directed her to speak briefly with the trial judge. The judge met with D.B. alone and asked that she not reveal any details about the deliberations. D.B. expressed concern about having to announce the verdict in open court. Afterward, the judge’s clerk helped calm D.B., and D.B. eventually returned to the courtroom, where she and the other jurors confirmed the announced verdicts.

 Lee Davis later challenged the validity of the verdict as well as certain jury instructions. With respect to the verdict, Lee Davis submitted an affidavit from D.B. indicating that the private meeting affected her willingness to announce agreement with one of the counts. The trial judge, citing rules that limit the use of juror testimony to impeach a verdict, concluded that certain aspects of the affidavit could not be considered. As for the jury instructions, counsel for Lee Davis argued that the judge’s formulations did not adequately address key legal elements for the charged offenses. The judge, however, had given instructions that, in the judge’s view, correctly stated the applicable law and the definitions of intent.

 One set of arguments for Lee Davis centers on the principle that any private communication with a sitting juror can be presumed prejudicial under cases such as Remmer, placing a heavy burden on the opposing party to prove otherwise. Supporters of Lee Davis point out that D.B. privately asked the judge for guidance while visibly distraught, raising concerns about undue pressure or influence at a critical moment. They emphasize that constraints on jurors’ affidavits under Rule 606(b) may make it difficult to assess the full impact on deliberations; thus, they urge that courts must be especially strict in preventing non-public communications between a judge and an individual juror. According to these arguments, remedial procedures typically require prompt notice to counsel and a thorough examination to determine the communication’s effect. When such procedures are not followed, they argue, failure to maintain transparency undermines confidence in the verdict. Lee Davis’s side cites these standards and maintains that the government must show that the contact did not prejudice the verdict. From this perspective, the government’s inability to fully examine objective and subjective effects of the judge’s meeting with D.B. underscores why, on these arguments, a new proceeding would be the fair result. Moreover, regarding jury instructions, Lee Davis argues that certain requested clarifications on intent and elements of the offense needed to be included to ensure the jury’s correct understanding of the law.

 Another set of arguments supports the United States, asserting that any ex parte communication with D.B. was limited to a matter of her comfort and emotional state, without encroaching on substantive issues. People making these arguments point to the judge’s prompt warning to D.B. not to discuss deliberations or verdict details, emphasizing that the judge only aimed to ensure that D.B. could fulfill her role. On these arguments, the government would maintain that the trial judge is personally in the best position to determine whether the contact influenced the jury, so the judge’s assessment that the exchange merely calmed D.B. is entitled to deference. Such arguments rely on the principle that not all communications between a judge and a juror are prejudicial and that, absent clear evidence of improper influence, the verdict should stand. Regarding the challenged instructions, supporters of the United States insist that the court correctly described each element, provided sufficient definitions, and duly explained intent and the need for the government to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, thus meeting all legal requirements for instructing the jury. They also note that the court’s refusal to give Lee Davis’s proposed language does not necessarily mean the instructions were incomplete, as the core legal concepts required under the relevant federal statutes were adequately conveyed.
