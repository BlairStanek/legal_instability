You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Max Reed held a blue-collar job with the Town of Redwood in New Jersey. After initially residing in Redwood, he moved elsewhere in the state, citing concerns about his family’s health and safety. When Redwood officials learned of his new address, they notified him that he was violating a local requirement mandating that most municipal employees keep their primary residence within town limits. This dispute led to an action in the district court brought by both Max Reed and the Redwood Blue Collar Workers Association (the labor organization representing various Redwood employees). They argued that Redwood could not constitutionally force Reed to live within the town as a condition of continued employment.

 The contested local rule is the Redwood Municipal Residency Ordinance #78-3. It declares that, absent a recognized exception, any full-time employee of Redwood must maintain actual residence inside the town. The stated justifications include the desire to reduce unemployment among Redwood residents, improve on-the-job punctuality, foster strong ties between employees and the locality, prepare a robust workforce available for emergencies, and create economic benefits for Redwood. Reed and the Redwood Blue Collar Workers Association contended that these rationales infringed certain constitutional protections.

 In defending its policy, Redwood pointed out that some categories of employees, such as certain specialists and those holding positions exempted by state law, are not required to reside in the town. Among the employees grandfathered under the ordinance were some who had lived outside Redwood before the ordinance went into effect. Reed and the Redwood Blue Collar Workers Association argued that the ordinance had been selectively enforced, noting that it seemed to be rarely applied. They further maintained that Reed received little or no advance notification of the requirement when he began working, whereas Redwood maintained that the ordinance was posted and that Reed was given ample time to relocate before any formal action. The Redwood Blue Collar Workers Association also pointed to the array of state statutes exempting certain municipal positions from local residency rules, arguing that only clerical and manual-labor positions remained covered, thus making the classification especially questionable.

 In support of the Town of Redwood’s position, it was argued that employment with a government entity differs from private sector work and has never been deemed a fundamental privilege subject to heightened constitutional scrutiny. Citing various precedents that uphold municipal residency rules against equal protection challenges under a rational basis test, Redwood contended that requiring employees to live in the town serves legitimate purposes, such as encouraging workers to feel a vested interest in local affairs, decreasing tardiness, and ensuring personnel are readily available during emergencies. It likewise cited examples of courts determining that residency rules can promote a stable community workforce. Additionally, Redwood argued that state laws allowing exceptions for police, firefighters, or other specialized officials do not undermine the validity of Redwood’s broader policy, because such statutory exemptions reflect distinct workplace exigencies recognized by the legislature. According to Redwood, the measure is properly grounded in established case law holding that public entities may set reasonable conditions for employment.

 In support of the Redwood Blue Collar Workers Association’s position, it was argued that the right to pursue employment without unwarranted interference is fundamental and protected against unfair discrimination. By conditioning continued employment on residency, Redwood’s policy effectively burdens individuals from out of state or from other municipalities who seek to work in Redwood. Citing decisions that protect nonresidents’ opportunities to pursue a livelihood, the Association claimed that Redwood’s residency rule should not be shielded solely because Redwood is expending municipal resources or employing workers directly. The Association maintained that Redwood’s rationale is too broad, since the exemptions due to state statutes or grandfathered status show that the rule is applied only to a subset of workers, undermining its claimed purpose. It further contended that unless Redwood can articulate a strong connection between the residency rule and a pressing local concern, courts should reject the ordinance under established precedent that invalidates limits on labor mobility or on pursuit of a common calling. Moreover, the Association argued that Redwood enforced the requirement inconsistently and provided inadequate notice to workers, raising questions over the ordinance’s fairness and the real reason behind its adoption.
