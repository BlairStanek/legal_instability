You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In early January of 1991, Morgan Brown was hired under a temporary appointment as a housekeeping aide at Clearfield Hospital, a facility run by the Veterans Administration. Brown was eligible for this position because of a service-connected disability involving rheumatoid arthritis. At the time of hiring, Brown was informed that steady attendance at Clearfield Hospital was of high importance.

 During the first few months of Brown’s employment, he missed work on several different days. In total, he was absent six times over a period of roughly two and a half months. Some of these absences were attributable to the adverse effects of the bi-weekly treatment Brown received for his condition; others were related to flare-ups of the arthritis itself, and at least one involved an unrelated medical issue. Brown contends that he was ready to work on one of these occasions but was sent back home and told to return another day.

 After these absences accrued, the Veterans Administration proceeded to end Brown’s temporary appointment, citing what it deemed irregular and unpredictable attendance. Brown then challenged the termination, asserting that it was based entirely on matters stemming from his disability and that a disability-related accommodation could have addressed his attendance difficulties. Brown maintained that he did not exceed the amount of leave made available to him. He requested, among other options, schedule modifications such as part-time or later shifts, swapping days off with other employees, or deferring some tasks for a day until he was able to lift or move objects safely.

 The arguments presented for the Veterans Administration’s position rely in part on Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and precedents like Southeastern Community College v. Davis. They assert that an individual must be able to perform the essential elements of the position, and that reliable on-site presence can be an essential function for a housekeeping aide at a hospital, given the daily need to empty trash, clean floors, and attend to bathrooms in real time. Citing decisions such as Walders v. Garrett, Wimbley v. Bolger, and Matzo v. Postmaster General, they claim that an employee whose attendance is sporadic or unpredictable cannot perform all necessary tasks in a workplace where tasks must be accomplished at certain times. This party contends that requiring significant last-minute work reassignments to cover absences would impose undue hardship on the day-to-day hospital operations. Moreover, they maintain that the nature of Brown’s condition made it impossible for the facility to predict or rearrange tasks in advance for each flare-up or treatment side effect, and that no feasible adjustments—beyond the standard leave Brown already had—could fully accommodate an inability to come to work on short notice.

 The arguments presented on behalf of Morgan Brown are grounded in the same statutory framework, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, focusing on the contention that he was qualified for the position but ultimately affected by the direct manifestations of his disability. Brown points to limited case law, such as Kimbro v. Atlantic-Richfield Co. and Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co., to show that absences due to a disability are not per se disqualifying when they fall within allotted leave or could be accommodated through measures like flexible scheduling or task adjustments. He asserts that his requests for shifting his start time, switching workdays with coworkers, or postponing heavier tasks until flare-ups subsided were potentially reasonable accommodations. Brown emphasizes that he missed only the time regarded as necessary for treatment and recovery, and that some form of job restructuring or modified work schedule could have allowed him to complete his assigned responsibilities without fundamentally altering the housekeeping aide position.
