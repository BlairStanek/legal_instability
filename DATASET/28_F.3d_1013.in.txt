You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Silverwood Co. is a business entity engaged in processing animal bones, which it obtains from beef packing plants. It sought to utilize these bones—considered by many to be waste material—to create a valuable product for sale. Silverwood Co. designed and built a facility specifically to process these bones into a substance that could be used in the photographic industry.

 A shift in the regional meat-processing market near Abbeyville led to an abundant supply of bones. Observing the potential for profitable production, Silverwood Co. developed specialized equipment to handle, sort, and transform these animal parts into a new raw material. On its tax return, Silverwood Co. claimed an investment credit on the theory that its facility met the statutory requirements for “recycling equipment.”

 The Commissioner of Internal Revenue scrutinized the claimed credit, concluding that a regulation interpreting the governing tax statute did not allow equipment used for processing animal waste to qualify for a particular energy-related incentive. The Commissioner also contended that the equipment did not meet a core statutory definition of “recycle,” reasoning that processing the bones into a distinct product was not, in a technical sense, a cyclical reuse of the original material. Disagreement therefore arose over both whether the facility actually performed “recycling” as that term is used in the law and whether the regulatory exclusion for animal waste was valid.

 For the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the key legal arguments rest on the claim that the relevant statute and regulations do not support Silverwood Co.’s position that equipment converting animal bones into a different product should qualify as “recycling.” According to these arguments, “recycling” properly refers to processes that return waste to a form closely resembling the original raw material, such as taking used newspapers and producing paper suitable for the same or similar use. Statutory language and legislative materials are cited in support of a narrower, cyclical concept of “recycle.” Regulations excluding animal waste from certain credits are presented as a reasonable exercise of congressionally delegated rulemaking authority. Precedent emphasizes that courts generally defer to an administrative agency’s permissible construction of a tax provision, especially when the statute in question does not explicitly define the contested term and the rulemaking is authorized by law.

 Silverwood Co. advances several arguments in favor of eligibility for the credit. It contends that the bones are indisputably a solid waste and that the process of turning them into a new product qualifies as “recycling.” Among the points raised is that the ordinary meaning of “recycle” is broad and includes transforming waste items into something valuable, regardless of whether the end product is similar to the original form. The company also challenges the justification for excluding animal waste, pointing to the lack of statutory language that carves out this specific exception. It maintains that an agency must adhere to the plain meaning of the law and cannot impose additional limitations that Congress did not include. The emphasis is on traditional dictionary definitions and on precedents holding that an agency’s regulation is invalid if it strays from the commonly understood sense of an undefined statutory term.
