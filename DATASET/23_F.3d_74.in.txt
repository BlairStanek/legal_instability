You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In the mid-1980s, The Government filed charges against Tristan Lopez under 21 U.S.C. § 848, alleging that he was involved in a continuing criminal enterprise. Proceedings took place before the district court in North Carolina, and a jury heard evidence over several weeks. According to the record, multiple witnesses testified in detail about the organization and structure of the alleged criminal operation.

 The Government’s evidence focused on whether Mr. Lopez served in a leadership role within the operation or operated under the direction of others. Various recorded communications and testimony from cooperating witnesses suggested he facilitated the distribution of illegal substances over an extended time period. Mr. Lopez’s counsel, however, challenged the portrayal of him as a principal player; they argued at trial that associates higher in the organization were the primary leaders, which might make Mr. Lopez’s role comparatively peripheral.

 Mr. Lopez asked the district court to instruct the jury on an alternate charge under 18 U.S.C. § 2 for aiding and abetting, in addition to any question of whether he served as a principal under 21 U.S.C. § 848. The jury ultimately returned a verdict finding Mr. Lopez responsible under one of these theories, while choosing not to hold him liable under the other. Mr. Lopez subsequently pursued a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, arguing, among other things, that instructing the jury on an aiding and abetting theory in conjunction with a continuing criminal enterprise was improper. He further claimed insufficient evidence existed to show that he aided and abetted rather than simply worked for others. After receiving the district court’s ruling on his motion, Mr. Lopez continued to dispute whether he could be convicted under the aiding and abetting statute for a continuing criminal enterprise.

 In support of The Government’s position in the litigation, several arguments have been identified. First, it is contended that when a party explicitly requests a particular jury instruction, any later challenge to that instruction should not succeed under the doctrine sometimes referred to as invited error. Citing authorities such as Shields v. United States and Wilson v. Lindler, proponents of this view maintain that a defendant cannot invite a particular instruction and then claim it was given in error. Second, The Government’s arguments point out that any dissenting rulings by other appellate courts are not binding on the district court in North Carolina; thus, reliance on a separate circuit’s opinion, like United States v. Amen, does not strictly control the outcome. Third, The Government emphasizes that 21 U.S.C. § 848 can be interpreted in parallel with 18 U.S.C. § 2, so long as a court legitimately finds the evidence supports a participant’s role as an aider or abettor. These arguments together suggest that, from The Government’s standpoint, any conviction based on the requested instruction has a sound legal foundation.

 Those favoring Mr. Lopez’s position focus on a different set of arguments to assert that the conviction should not stand. They cite the holding of United States v. Amen to suggest that 21 U.S.C. § 848 might not be combined with 18 U.S.C. § 2, thereby making an aiding and abetting theory inapplicable to the crime of continuing criminal enterprise. In their view, Congress never intended to create liability for aiding and abetting in this specific context, and endorsing such a theory imposes punishment for conduct not clearly enumerated as criminal. Additionally, there is an argument that, regardless of any jury request, a conviction for a crime not recognized by federal law raises concerns of fundamental fairness. They further contend that, if Mr. Lopez was acquitted of being a principal under 21 U.S.C. § 848, then establishing him as an aider and abettor for the same offense requires a degree of proof that the trial record may not clearly support. Taken together, these points are used to demonstrate that Mr. Lopez should be shielded from punishment for an offense that is arguably not cognizable under the existing statutory scheme.
