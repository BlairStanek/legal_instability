You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alex Drake was convicted of the murder of Morgan Hayes and received a death sentence. Some time later, questions arose about a meeting that allegedly occurred between the special prosecutor, Robin Edwards, and the sentencing judge, Judge Fowler. This meeting took place shortly after the guilty verdict and before sentencing. Alex Drake learned about it long after his conviction and sentencing. Because of this, Alex Drake sought relief in the federal courts, raising concerns centered on whether the meeting influenced the death penalty decision.

 In the course of post-conviction proceedings, Robin Edwards testified that the discussion with Judge Fowler focused on the special prosecutor’s compensation. The records showed the meeting lasted about 45 minutes. However, a reconstruction of earlier proceedings suggested that the meeting may have touched on aspects of the case concerning the brutality of the murder and other potentially aggravating details. Different judges in the district court held separate hearings and reviewed affidavits, depositions, and other documents due to concerns that the missing transcript from the first hearing had to be pieced together from recollections.

 Alex Drake maintained that this unrecorded meeting may have undermined the fairness of the sentencing, particularly because he did not know what points might have been raised by Robin Edwards at a crucial time. The State, for its part, consistently argued that no sentencing-related issues were actually discussed and that the meeting had no bearing on the decision to impose the death penalty. Over several rounds of evidentiary proceedings, witnesses provided accounts of the length of the meeting, the judge’s storytelling habits, and the special prosecutor’s reasons for the visit, all intended to determine whether the judge received any undisclosed or prejudicial information that could have affected the sentence.

 On one side, there is an argument that whenever potentially relevant sentencing matters could have been discussed—without the defendant’s knowledge—it raises constitutional concerns under principles set out in Gardner v. Florida. It is asserted that an ex parte meeting about the very case in which the judge would impose a capital sentence calls for strict scrutiny, suggesting that such contacts might be inherently prejudicial. This view emphasizes that imposing the death penalty makes procedural safeguards all the more critical, relying on the idea in cases like Remmer v. United States that certain undisclosed contacts are “presumptively prejudicial.” Thus, the strongest contentions here focus on the notion that Alex Drake should not have to prove with certainty what was specifically said during an unrecorded meeting; rather, the existence or possibility of sentencing-related conversation might place the burden on the State to show there was no prejudice.

 On the other side, there is an argument that the defendant must prove there was, in fact, a discussion relevant to sentencing that could have swayed the decision. It draws on the well-established principle that a final conviction and sentence carry a presumption of correctness, as described in Brecht v. Abrahamson, and that the petitioner, even in a capital case, must show more than an unsubstantiated possibility of improper influence. This position contends that the mere fact of an off-the-record communication does not necessarily mean sentencing issues were raised. Citing Gardner v. Florida to highlight that a constitutional violation arises only when relevant, undisclosed information actually plays a role in the sentencing, this view insists that Alex Drake needed to establish that the ex parte meeting included considerations that directly bore on punishment. If no such information was passed along, there would be no due process impact, so the burden should remain with the defendant to prove a direct connection to sentencing.
