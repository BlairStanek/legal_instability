You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Authorities at a mail facility in Lakeville uncovered a package sent from Peru addressed to Jordan Diaz in Townsburg, Illinois. Inside a brown leather notebook, they found hidden cocaine. Officers connected with the United States Postal Inspection Service orchestrated a controlled delivery to Jordan Diaz, who was promptly taken into custody. During questioning, Jordan Diaz claimed the narcotics belonged to Franklin Murdock and indicated that he had been directed to forward the cocaine to Murdock in Lakeville.

 Following Jordan Diaz’s statements, officers recorded telephone calls in which Franklin Murdock allegedly acknowledged ownership of the cocaine and instructed Diaz to send it. Believing they had probable cause to continue their investigation, officers secured a warrant to place an electronic beeper inside the mailed parcel so they would know when it was opened. They attempted to obtain a further warrant from the state court to enter the dwelling where the parcel might be opened, but paused those efforts upon learning that any entry would be delayed under state rules.

 The package was delivered to Franklin Murdock in the late evening, and officers set up surveillance. Hours later, in the early morning, the beeper activated, signaling the parcel was opened. Officers then entered Franklin Murdock’s residence without a warrant, advising him of his rights once inside. He provided consent to search and spoke to officers about his recent trip abroad and how he had acquired the cocaine. The district court considered a request to suppress the recovered narcotics and the statements, with both sides arguing over whether the entry was lawful under the circumstances.

 One argument is that the officers faced a legitimate concern that the drugs would be destroyed once the beeper was discovered. Under United States v. Young and other authorities, destroying narcotics presents a compelling situation justifying immediate action when there is probable cause. This view points to the narrow window of time in which the evidence could be saved, emphasizing that the risk of destruction forced officers to act without delay. Further invoked is the concept that officers need not suspend an investigation as soon as they have enough information for probable cause, relying on principles stating it is permissible for law enforcement to monitor the situation to identify exactly where and by whom illegal drugs will be handled. Given the difficulty of predicting the precise location or final recipient of the contraband, they stress that obtaining a warrant in advance might be both impractical and futile if circumstances changed after the parcel was delivered. Authorities argue that, in such volatile scenarios, immediate response is sanctioned once probable cause and urgent circumstances converge.

 Another argument suggests that officers had time to obtain the necessary warrant yet chose a strategy that led to a last-minute claim of emergency. This viewpoint highlights that once officers knew that Franklin Murdock was the intended recipient, they could have procured either a search or arrest warrant ahead of time, or at least secured a federal warrant that did not impose a waiting period. By planting the beeper inside the notebook, they allegedly manufactured the risk that the beeper would be found, thus creating their own emergency to bypass standard warrant procedures. Under cases such as United States v. Tobin and related authority, such conduct can be seen as law enforcement deliberately arranging conditions to justify an unannounced entry. Proponents of this argument maintain that the Fourth Amendment’s protection of the home requires extra caution, and that the officers, aware of ample probable cause, should not circumvent procedural safeguards by engineering an artificial time crunch through the placement of the device and a controlled delivery.
