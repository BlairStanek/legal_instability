You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In February 1987, Paterson filed a class action lawsuit challenging a forthcoming change to the eligibility rules of the Indiana Medicaid Program. Under the prior rules, real property was disregarded as an available resource if it was producing income or listed for sale at its fair market value. The new policy eliminated protections for property merely listed for sale and substituted a “$6000/6%” rule for income-producing property, meaning only $6000 in property generating at least a 6% return remained exempt. Class members included Indiana Medicaid applicants or recipients who would lose eligibility under this new framework.

 Nearly two years after the lawsuit began, the Indiana Department of Public Welfare reinstated the same exemption rules that had existed before 1987. As soon as the state reverted to its older policy, Paterson requested voluntary dismissal of the case, and the action concluded without any formal judgment. Paterson subsequently asked the relevant court to award attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Edwards opposed this request on the basis that no enforceable judgment existed and that at most, the changes were voluntary corrections unrelated to the lawsuit.

 An alternative view focused on the timing and cause for the reinstatement of the old rule. One side suggested that the reinstatement might have occurred in response to a broader change in federal law, specifically through the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, which allegedly allowed states to opt for more lenient eligibility rules than the federal baseline. Others argued that the lawsuit itself served as a catalyst for the state’s policy shift, noting that the reversal of the rule occurred close to a scheduled court conference, possibly indicating that the litigation brought pressure on Edwards.

 Paterson’s main legal arguments in favor of recovering attorney’s fees emphasize that 42 U.S.C. § 1988 has historically permitted “prevailing party” status even when a defendant changes its conduct voluntarily rather than being compelled by a court order. Paterson relies on key case precedents examining the “catalyst approach,” which suggests that a plaintiff can be deemed to have prevailed if the suit caused a defendant to grant the primary relief sought. Paterson contends that longstanding judicial interpretation cites various decisions holding that a formal judgment is not always necessary under § 1988 if a material change in the legal relationship occurs through voluntary action that directly results from the litigation. Paterson thus argues that the timing and nature of the state’s reversal indicate that the relief was obtained specifically because of the lawsuit, making Paterson eligible for fees despite the absence of a formal decree.

 Edwards’ main legal arguments center on the contention that case law, including Farrar v. Hobby, requires a clear enforcement mechanism—such as a consent decree, settlement, or formal judgment—before awarding fees under § 1988. Edwards argues that a purely voluntary change in conduct does not create a legal entitlement enforceable against the defendant and thus does not meet the “prevailing party” threshold. In support, Edwards points to language holding that only an enforceable judgment, or comparable relief evidenced by a court-approved agreement, can materially alter the legal relationship in a way that qualifies a plaintiff for attorney’s fees. Furthermore, Edwards maintains that in this situation, the operative fact was the shift in federal law that allowed the state to revert to older, more lenient eligibility rules, rather than any pressure applied by Paterson’s legal challenge. Under this view, there is no basis to award fees because the new policy was not truly forced or triggered by the litigation.
