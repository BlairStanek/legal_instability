You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, Mr. Campos was charged with conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it, and possession of the same with intent to distribute. The Government pursued the charges, and Mr. Campos appeared before the district court in Redwood Region to enter a guilty plea. The proceeding at issue involved an exchange between the judge, Mr. Campos, and counsel. During the hearing, the district court asked Mr. Campos questions about his mental state, education, and any inducements that might have led him to plead guilty.

 At an earlier phase of the proceedings, Mr. Campos had initially pleaded guilty to the same charges but was later allowed to withdraw that plea. He then returned some time afterward and entered another guilty plea to the same offenses. Mr. Campos contends that, at the later hearing, the district court accepted his plea at one point without first advising him of certain constitutional rights. The Government and the defendant then discussed whether there had been a thorough explanation of those rights and whether Mr. Campos needed to be re-informed of them.

 In the same hearing, after the court pronounced acceptance of the plea, it went on to detail several constitutional and procedural rights. Mr. Campos answered affirmatively when asked if he understood these rights and whether he was willing to waive them. The Government notes that the court had already covered a number of topics with Mr. Campos, such as the maximum penalties and the factual basis for the offense, but does not dispute that certain rights were read and explained only after the plea had apparently been declared accepted. Mr. Campos points out that he was never asked if he wished to change his mind after the full set of advisements was given.

 Mr. Campos’s strongest arguments for prevailing include an emphasis on the requirement that a defendant be made aware of all critical constitutional rights prior to entry of a guilty plea, as embodied in Rule 11(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He stresses that a plea must be an intentional and informed waiver of rights, referencing the principle contained in Boykin v. Alabama that mandates clarity in the record. Mr. Campos asserts that if a court states that a plea is accepted before informing a defendant of these rights, the acceptance is problematic because it deprives the defendant of the knowledge necessary to make a genuine choice. He underlines that the timing of the advisement is central to ensuring the validity of the waiver. He also points to caselaw indicating that defects in adherence to Rule 11 should be closely scrutinized for their impact on understanding and voluntariness.

 The Government’s strongest arguments, by contrast, rely on the assertion that any deviation from the procedure spelled out in Rule 11 should be regarded as minor if the overall record shows the defendant was made aware of his rights and understood them. Drawing on the notion that Rule 11(h) allows harmless error review, the Government contends that substantive compliance occurred because, immediately after pronouncing acceptance of the plea, the district court thoroughly explained constitutional protections. Citing precedent where courts have upheld pleas despite technical omissions, the Government emphasizes that Mr. Campos unequivocally acknowledged his rights and still wished to move forward. Therefore, according to the Government, the key inquiry is whether Mr. Campos, as demonstrated by the full colloquy, knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights, regardless of the precise order in which the warning and acceptance were delivered.
