You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Lee Bailey worked part-time in commercial fishing, and on a particular morning he went fishing with his child to catch tuna near the coast of Rosewood, Hawaii. At some point, four porpoises appeared and began feeding on fish that were on or near the fishing lines belonging to Bailey and the child. Bailey decided to use a rifle to fire shots in the water, behind the porpoises.

 According to statements later gathered by enforcement officials, Bailey did not aim to strike the animals directly but hoped the impact of the shots hitting the water would frighten them away. Afterward, upon reevaluating their bait and any remaining fish, Bailey and the child discovered at least one fish had been partially eaten by a porpoise.

 Some time after these events, a local enforcement officer contacted the Marine Resource Division, and agents from that agency interviewed Bailey and the child. Written statements were taken from both. The Government eventually charged Bailey under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, contending that firing rifle shots in the vicinity of the porpoises amounted to a prohibited “taking” of a marine mammal. Bailey argued that his acts did not constitute a criminal violation and also challenged the clarity of statutory and regulatory provisions regarding “harassment” or “take.”

 Bailey puts forth several legal arguments based on statutory language and regulations under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. He relies on the plain text of “take,” which includes terms such as “harass,” “hunt,” “capture,” or “kill,” and insists the words do not naturally encompass mere attempts to frighten animals away from fishing lines intended for lawful commercial purposes. Further, he underscores that the regulations mention direct and significant intrusions or disruptions to marine mammals’ life-sustaining behaviors, suggesting his act was limited in scope and duration. He also notes that the Marine Mammal Protection Act’s emphasis on knowing acts of taking implies a heightened standard that should exclude reasonable, momentary deterrence. Finally, he suggests the Act’s structure, along with certain regulatory statements about when “harassment” becomes significant, demonstrates that a fisher’s temporary and limited actions to prevent porpoises from consuming bait or hooked fish should fall outside the boundaries of what the Act prohibits, provided the conduct does not severely disrupt the animals’ natural routines.

 The Government invokes broad statutory and regulatory authority under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, highlighting Congress’s intent to regulate human activities that might harm or disturb marine mammals. It calls attention to the Act’s definition of “take,” which includes “harass” in addition to straightforward acts like killing or capturing, thereby covering a wide array of conduct. The Government underscores that the Act was formulated with a protective orientation—erring on the side of conservation—and that even seemingly minor disruptions may lead to negative behavioral changes over time. Further, the Government refers to the regulatory examples of “harassment,” noting that the prohibition extends to disturbing or molesting marine mammals in a way that alters their feeding patterns, whether or not they are physically harmed. According to the Government, firing rifle shots near porpoises qualifies as a deliberate attempt to interfere with or disturb them in their feeding activity, placing the behavior well within the realm of regulated conduct under the Act.
