You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On a weekday afternoon, Jacob Evans and three associates—Sarah Adams, Luis Santos, and Daniel Garcia—carried out a robbery of Metro Federal Bank in Lincoln Beach, Florida. According to accounts, Evans jumped over the teller counter holding a handgun, while Santos and Garcia held the bank occupants at bay with another handgun and what was described as a machine pistol. Evans allegedly demanded that the assistant manager open the vault within three seconds under threat of harm, then seized two strong boxes containing a substantial sum of money. After instructing the people inside to carry on with their business, Evans and the others fled to a waiting car, driven by Adams, and placed their weapons and the money in the trunk.

 Subsequently, only Garcia was taken into custody in Lincoln Beach shortly after authorities were alerted. Evans later pleaded guilty to multiple counts of armed bank robbery, including earlier incidents in the Fairview area. At the sentencing phase, the district court noted various aspects of the robbery, such as the presence of multiple armed participants, threats made to employees, and the time of day when numerous bystanders could have been in harm’s way. The court also considered the level of planning and whether Evans’s demeanor during the robbery indicated any greater danger or threat.

 In formulating the sentence, the district court referenced the United States Sentencing Guidelines, particularly U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1 for robbery and associated provisions. Adjustments were made for the use of firearms, the nature of the financial establishment, and the amount taken. Various other guideline sections were invoked, including those that address the defendant’s role in the offense and the acceptance of responsibility. The primary dispute turned on whether certain factors—like the number of weapons, any explicit or implicit threat of death, and endangerment of the public—were already factored into the guideline calculations or could serve as separate grounds for a further increase.

 In arguing that the sentence should reflect additional considerations beyond the standard calculations, the first party relies on provisions of U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0, emphasizing that courts retain authority to account for aggravating or mitigating circumstances not adequately covered by the guideline range. Citing United States v. Weaver and 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3), this party contends that when the offense conduct is outside ordinary expectations—involving numerous weapon-wielding participants or especially alarming methods—an upward adjustment may be appropriate so as to reflect the heightened seriousness. It cites the structured gradations in U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2), along with references to cases like United States v. Farrier, to underscore that explicit, individualized traits of this particular robbery could warrant setting a higher penalty than the general scenario accounted for by the baseline guidelines. The position is that the guidelines, while comprehensive, do not always capture the precise extent of danger created by multiple armed individuals employing threats of lethal violence before bank employees and the public.

 In response, the second party relies just as strongly on the same statutory framework, including the text and structure of U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1, to argue that weapons usage, danger to bystanders, and threats are already thoroughly integrated into the established guideline scheme. Citing United States v. Nakagawa and United States v. Baker, this party asserts that, for a robbery charge, the guidelines anticipate most scenarios in which firearms and threats are involved, and that courts should not double count factors already considered by the provisions. Moreover, references are made to United States v. Brewer and related decisions to stress that departures should be reserved for truly extraordinary cases—such as kidnappings or large-scale arsenals—and that this particular offense does not deviate enough from the norm of armed robberies to justify an increase for aspects that are characteristic of the crime itself. By pointing to the express language woven into § 2B3.1(b)(1)–(b)(2) regarding financial institutions and the presence or use of firearms, this party maintains that no additional upward adjustment is warranted once these baseline enhancements have been applied.
