You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alex Marquez was charged after firing shots through the front door of Maria Perez’s home following an argument in which Maria Perez ran inside. Alex Marquez claimed there was no intent to kill, insisting he only meant to frighten Maria Perez and waited until he thought she was clear of the door. However, he did not request lesser included offenses, and the jury received instructions only on attempted murder and related standard instructions.

 During deliberations, the jury twice told the trial judge they could not reach a verdict. Both times, the judge asked for the numerical division of the vote and how it had changed over time. Initially, the jury split from about seven to five, then eight to four, eventually reaching nine to three. The judge noted there had been some movement and encouraged deliberations to continue. After a break, the jury again reported an impasse, this time splitting eleven to one.

 Despite the suggestion from both sides that a mistrial might be warranted rather than pressuring a single holdout juror, the trial judge again inquired about numerical movement. Upon learning more progress had been made, the judge asked the jury to deliberate further for the remainder of the day. Some time later, the jury returned a verdict. Alex Marquez pursued further relief before the state appellate court and the state supreme court, eventually filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus at the federal level.

 Alex Marquez’s arguments emphasized that the repeated inquiries into the jury’s numerical division could have improperly pressured the holdout juror to abandon a sincerely held belief. Relying on the due process guarantee under the Fourteenth Amendment and guided by decisions analyzing jury coercion under the totality of the circumstances, Alex Marquez maintained that when a trial judge notes the changing split and asks jurors to continue moving toward unanimity, it effectively compels those in the minority to conform. Citing cases discussing Allen instructions, Alex Marquez argued that any procedure which fails to remind jurors not to surrender conscientiously held views violates fundamental fairness. Alex Marquez contended that the judge’s approach created a perception there was an expectation that the minority must yield, infringing upon the duty of jurors to reach individual conclusions based on the evidence.

 The People maintained that the trial judge’s actions did not unduly pressure any juror, emphasizing that judges in many jurisdictions have discretion to inquire into the feasibility of further deliberations before declaring a mistrial. Citing precedent in which courts have permitted neutral questions about the likelihood of a verdict, The People stressed that merely determining whether progress has been made is not coercive. They contended the trial judge repeatedly focused on whether the split was moving at all, rather than insisting on a particular outcome. The People also noted that a trial court may balance avoiding a hung jury against protecting each juror’s independence, arguing that so long as no explicit demand is made upon dissenting jurors to abandon their beliefs, the practice accords with constitutional standards under a totality of the circumstances approach.
