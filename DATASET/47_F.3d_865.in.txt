You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The first party is a municipal entity in Illinois that issued a written personnel manual to its employees. The second party, Adrian Green, worked there as superintendent of recreation. Green was dismissed from employment, and the circumstances of that termination gave rise to questions about whether Green had any entitlement to remain employed under the terms set out in the personnel manual.

 The manual stated that departments, with approval from upper management, could dismiss an employee for “just cause.” However, the same manual also contained language declaring that it was not intended to be construed as an employment contract. Green, when dismissed, pointed to the “just cause” wording and argued that this language suggested more than at-will employment. The municipal entity, for its part, referred to the disclaimer on the first page and elsewhere, emphasizing that the disclaimer indicated no enforceable contractual promise.

 In the background was a multi-step grievance process outlined by the manual. Under that process, an employee could challenge a dismissal through successive levels of review, culminating in the governing board’s final determination. The manual did not clearly specify whether the governing board itself was required to adhere to “just cause” as a binding condition. Green did not pursue the full grievance procedure, but maintained the position that the “just cause” language should protect employees from unjustified terminations.

 In support of the municipal entity, one argument focuses on the disclaimer’s explicit statement that the manual is not a contract, which, the argument continues, means employees have no enforceable “property” right to continued employment. Citing precedents such as Board of Regents v. Roth and Perry v. Sindermann, this side emphasizes that state law must grant a legitimate claim of entitlement before any constitutional protections of continued employment can arise. It is further argued that because the manual disclaims contractual force, no mutual obligation is formed, eliminating the possibility of a legally cognizable property interest. According to this view, language requiring “just cause” applies only as an internal managerial guideline and is not meant to confer any right on employees. References to other cases underscore that disclaimers or unenforceable promises do not establish a property right where state law will not treat such manual provisions as binding.

 In support of Green, another argument highlights that certain language in the manual—especially the “just cause” requirement—could create a reasonable expectation among employees that they would not be fired arbitrarily. These advocates rely on Perry v. Sindermann to assert that a meaningful “mutually explicit understanding” can exist even without a formal contract. They cite authority holding that an express disclaimer does not automatically defeat a property interest, especially where the disclaimers might lack prominence or might stand in tension with other detailed promises in the same handbook. In addition, they point to doctrines suggesting that a public employer’s policy statements, practices, or established procedures may generate legitimate reliance interests on the part of employees, even if no contractual relationship is formally recognized. This perspective also emphasizes that a multi-step grievance process can imply enforceable procedural protections because employees may reasonably believe that “just cause” will govern final decisions, giving rise to a constitutionally cognizable interest.
