You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A petitioner named Jordan Carter submitted filings to the district court on behalf of an individual named Michael Baker, who was under a death sentence in Idaho. Cameron Hall is the opposing party in this matter. Carter sought intervention by claiming “next-friend” status because Baker had allegedly dismissed his own counsel and expressed a desire for a rapid resolution of his legal challenges.

 Baker’s history included defenses and appeals in the state district court related to questions of ineffective assistance of counsel, the lawfulness of the sentence, and allegations surrounding his actual innocence. At one point, the state district court had appointed an attorney named Alex Mitchell to represent Baker during trial but then replaced him with Carter for appellate proceedings. Baker later dismissed Carter, saying he wanted to end the legal challenges. Despite objections that Mitchell faced a conflict of interest, the state district court reappointed Mitchell to represent Baker. A short competency proceeding took place in the state district court, producing a written psychological report. Carter maintained that Baker had substantial mental health issues, but the state district court found him competent without live testimony or additional examination.

 Carter subsequently filed a habeas petition in the district court for that state, again contending that Baker’s competence was doubtful. Carter’s filing included motions seeking a full review of relevant state-court records, along with affidavits alleging serious mental illness and describing Baker’s belief that harmful forces could only be removed by his own death. The district court dismissed these requests on the ground that Carter lacked standing. Carter then immediately pursued appellate review in the appeals court. The time between the final state proceedings, the federal district court’s dismissal, and the subsequent appeal was extremely short. Throughout these proceedings, there were objections that no hearing offered Carter the chance to present additional live testimony or to question any of the findings regarding Baker’s mental competence.

 Cameron Hall relies on multiple legal principles that emphasize the limited scope of federal review over state-court findings. Citing precedents such as Demosthenes v. Baal and Brewer v. Lewis, Hall maintains that courts should defer to state determinations of competency when no meaningful new evidence has emerged to contradict those findings under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. From Hall’s perspective, the prior competency investigations—however brief—met the required standards, and Baker’s statements of understanding demonstrate rational awareness of the proceedings against him. According to Hall, Carter provided no substantial proof of Baker’s incompetence sufficient to trigger a fresh evidentiary process. Hall further argues that standing requirements for a third party to litigate on behalf of a fully competent person are exceptionally strict, and Carter’s filings did not meet those prerequisites. Hall contends that any renewed inquiry into Baker’s competency would be unwarranted absent clear and convincing reasons that the state proceedings misapplied law or overlooked valid evidence of mental impairment.

 Jordan Carter argues that well-established federal habeas principles, including the requirement of a “full and fair” hearing under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), were not satisfied. Citing the need for a more extensive adversarial process, Carter emphasizes that Baker’s mental health record, including evidence of serious thought disorders, necessitated testimony, cross-examination of medical experts, and a genuine opportunity to offer contradictory expert evidence. Carter insists that the incomplete nature of the proceedings violated Baker’s constitutional right to due process because there was no live hearing or opportunity to test the accuracy of the purportedly equivocal psychological report. Furthermore, references to decisions such as Brewer v. Lewis and Demosthenes v. Baal, Carter asserts, should not foreclose a new hearing if there is a legitimate question of Baker’s competency. Carter underscores that if Baker’s competency was not reliably assessed, there is a substantial risk that his conviction and sentence were obtained in violation of the Constitution. Carter also contends that the denial of standing prevented any proper presentation of Baker’s claims of actual innocence or improper sentencing, arguing that these issues independently demand thorough review before any irreversible punishment goes forward.
