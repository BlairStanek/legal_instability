You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, Henry Dawson was prosecuted after an informant, Mark Redding, alerted the District Attorney’s Office in Clay County that Dawson wanted to sell stolen treasury checks. Dawson and Redding had previously met while serving prison time for fraud. Redding was cooperating with various government offices, hoping to reduce potential exposure on unrelated charges.

 Dawson and Redding negotiated details for a proposed sale of checks that Dawson claimed came from an associate, Thomas Knight, who was connected to a check-cashing business. Dawson also initiated contact with Maria Carter for a sample check when Knight was unavailable. Dawson continued to communicate with Redding to finalize the transaction, with the plan to deliver a large number of treasury checks in exchange for payment.

 On the arranged day, Dawson met with Redding and others in a hotel parking lot. John Francis provided the checks, and Allen Myers acted as a lookout. Law enforcement made arrests soon thereafter. Following the arrest, Dawson stated that Knight originally approached him about the deal and that he was uninterested until Redding pushed the idea to prove Dawson’s reliability before investing in a mortgage venture. Dawson maintained that both the supplier and Redding themselves had government ties, suggesting he was drawn into the scheme from both sides.

 Henry Dawson contends that the entrapment instructions given to the jury require closer scrutiny under Jacobson v. United States. He asserts that the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was predisposed to commit the offense before any government involvement began. Dawson points to language in precedents such as that in Jacobson indicating a jury must be instructed to focus on a defendant’s mental state prior to government conduct. He argues that instructions must clearly inform a jury that developing readiness after the Government enters the picture is not enough for guilt under an entrapment analysis. Thus, Dawson argues that any ambiguity in the jury charge could undermine the requirement that the Government shoulder the burden of showing preexisting criminal intent.

 The Government responds that the instructions used in this matter are consistent with established law and that they conveyed the need to find that Dawson was willing to commit such offenses prior to any interaction with official agents. According to the Government, these instructions accurately informed the jury that if it concluded that Dawson was already ready and able to commit such a crime once the opportunity arose, then entrapment would not apply. The Government points out that commonly approved formulations of the entrapment rule use similar wording, and it cites decisions interpreting Jacobson v. United States to permit language explaining that government inducement alone is insufficient if a defendant was nevertheless prepared to break the law. Thus, the Government highlights that it gave the jury enough guidance to make a precise determination of whether Dawson had an independent criminal purpose before law enforcement became involved.
