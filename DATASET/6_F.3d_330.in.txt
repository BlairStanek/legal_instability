You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Maritime Fuel LLC operated a barge called the Barge HAWK and a tugboat called the Tugboat LEO. On one voyage, the Barge HAWK arrived at a facility owned by Orange Oil Group so it could receive fuel. The decedent, Alex Carter, worked aboard these vessels as a deckhand employed by Maritime Fuel LLC. Orange Oil Group’s facility included several piers. One of these piers had a readily available walkway or ingress/egress system, but another pier lacked such a structure. Initially, the Barge HAWK was positioned at a pier with a functional walkway system; however, Orange Oil Group requested that the barge be repositioned to another pier that had no dedicated walkway.

 Because of the facility’s scheduling needs and multiple vessels arriving, Orange Oil Group instructed the Barge HAWK to shift positions more than once. On the final repositioning, Alex Carter left the barge by using an aluminum extension ladder belonging to Maritime Fuel LLC in order to help secure the barge to the pier. When attempting to climb back onto the Barge HAWK, Carter fell from the ladder, struck his head, and tragically drowned.

 Carter’s family reached a settlement with Maritime Fuel LLC that did not include certain claimed damages. Thereafter, Maritime Fuel LLC and Carter’s family joined together to seek additional recovery from Orange Oil Group. They alleged that Orange Oil Group had failed to provide a safe means of accessing the barge from the pier and also failed to assist in the vessel’s mooring operations. The plaintiffs noted that Orange Oil Group had installed or maintained safe access systems at some piers in its facility, and argued that this established a pattern of providing means of ingress and egress for similar vessels.

 One set of arguments suggests that Orange Oil Group bears no responsibility for providing or supervising the barge’s access. These arguments emphasize well-recognized principles holding that a dock or pier is generally treated as being land-based and that the obligation to furnish, maintain, and verify the condition of a safe gangway or ladder rests with Maritime Fuel LLC. Proponents rely on the idea that a vessel owner has the fundamental duty to ensure a seaworthy craft with means of secure access for its own crew. They also underscore precedents noting that a pier owner is not expected to assume duties traditionally held by vessel owners and operators, and that no general maritime rule imposes an automatic requirement for the dock owner to offer additional gangways. Further, they point to the notion that a pier owner’s responsibility to keep premises in a reasonable condition does not extend to furnishing specialized equipment or manpower when the vessel typically provides its own. These arguments cite varying judicial decisions classifying the gangway obligation as belonging to a vessel’s owner, rather than the pier’s owner.

 The other set of arguments maintains that Orange Oil Group should be charged with an obligation to supply or arrange for safe access from the barge to the pier under the circumstances of this particular facility’s operations. These arguments stress that, on this occasion, Orange Oil Group directed the Barge HAWK to a pier that lacked any standard walkway or ladder arrangement while aware that the vessel might lack its own dedicated gangway. The argument highlights that Orange Oil Group had the superior ability to foresee the risk and already provided, at other piers, safer or more practical ways to board and depart. Citing general maritime principles of reasonable care, supporters of this position emphasize that a pier owner who knows or should know of particular dangers could be required to furnish safer equipment or warn of the absence of a suitable gangplank. They also draw on the principle that each party in maritime settings has a responsibility to minimize foreseeable hazards under maritime tort standards, suggesting that directing a barge to a pier without a standard access system might breach a duty of care.
