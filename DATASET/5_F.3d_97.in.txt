You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A vessel captain named Steele disappeared while attempting to cross between vessels moored together on the Grand River near Bayview. Steele was the captain of the M/V Harpy, which belonged to Lighthouse Barge Lines. That evening, he walked over a set of barges under the care of RiverDock Repair. One of these barges, Barge HAR-9, belonged to Harbor Enterprises and was operated by Dockside Management. The deck of Barge HAR-9 was covered with fertilizer residue, making it slippery. Steele wore cowboy boots rather than the required work shoes and did not carry a flashlight or wear a safety vest. No one saw him fall, but his body was later found in the water; the cause of death was drowning.

 Before Steele’s accident, Barge HAR-9 had been brought to RiverDock Repair for work unrelated to the fertilizer on its deck. Lighthouse Barge Lines had moored the M/V Harpy outboard of a second barge, Barge RDR-401, which itself was outboard of Barge HAR-9. An approximately eighteen-inch gap separated Barge RDR-401 from Barge HAR-9. According to various accounts, personnel of Harbor Enterprises and Dockside Management knew that Barge HAR-9 carried fertilizer residue but did not request or pay RiverDock Repair to remove it. Representatives from Harbor Enterprises and Dockside Management periodically inspected their barges, but there was no indication they had inspected this barge for the slippery residue shortly before the incident.

 The relatives of Captain Steele brought claims against multiple parties, including Harbor Enterprises and Dockside Management, alleging that the fertilizer residue on Barge HAR-9 created an unsafe condition. Harbor Enterprises and Dockside Management, in turn, maintained that RiverDock Repair was in custody of the vessel for the purpose of making repairs. Additionally, Lighthouse Barge Lines, the captain’s Jones Act employer, faced claims related to its role in mooring practices and the captain’s safe passage. Earlier legal filings by various parties led to extensive arguments over which entities bore responsibility for the barge’s condition and any precautions needed for those crossing it.

 One key set of arguments supporting the Steele Family focuses on a vessel owner's duty to use reasonable care under general maritime law, commonly cited in precedents such as Kermarec. From that perspective, a vessel owner should anticipate that individuals like Captain Steele will traverse decks and must ensure those decks are reasonably safe, regardless of whether the barge is awaiting or undergoing repairs. Such arguments highlight that fertilizer residue left on the deck is a hazard easily remedied by basic cleaning procedures or warnings. They point out that prior cases, including Verdin and others, show that vessel owners have been held accountable when dangerous conditions existed on a barge’s deck, even after the vessel was placed in a third party’s care. According to these arguments, the mere handover of a barge to a repair service does not extinguish all obligations to maintain a safe condition for lawful entrants, especially if the hazard lies outside the immediate area of intended repair.

 On the other side, the legal contentions advanced for Harbor Enterprises and Dockside Management strongly rely on the principle that responsibility for conditions aboard a vessel may shift when control passes to a repair facility. Citing analyses in cases such as Stass and Meserole, it is argued that once the barge is delivered to a facility for repairs, the burden rests with that facility to maintain safe walkways and remove hazards, particularly when the repair facility customarily performs or offers cleaning services. According to this position, any slip risk posed by fertilizer on the deck should have been handled by RiverDock Repair because its workers sought access to the barge and had control over who crossed it. Advocates of this view also note that regulations require repairers to provide safeguards and remedy known hazards, underscoring that the owner and operator may reasonably rely on the repair facility’s expertise and oversight in such circumstances.
