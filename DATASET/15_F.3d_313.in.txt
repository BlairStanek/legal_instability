You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


From approximately March through December of a given year, Foxline Freight Services transported many shipments—totaling several hundred—on behalf of Anderton Electronics. Before these shipments began, Foxline Freight Services and Anderton Electronics signed a written Transportation Agreement. This agreement referenced Foxline Freight Services operating as a motor carrier under certain authority from a federal commission. According to the agreement, Anderton Electronics did not guarantee a minimum number of shipments, tonnage, or revenue, but the agreement included a detailed schedule of negotiated rates to be paid.

 During that same time frame, Foxline Freight Services encountered financial difficulties and eventually entered bankruptcy. Subsequently, Cavalry Auditors took over Foxline Freight Services’s right to seek additional freight charges from shippers if the amounts paid under negotiated rates were found to be lower than rates required by any officially filed tariffs. Cavalry Auditors then began audits of accounts, including the one that existed between Anderton Electronics and Foxline Freight Services under their agreement.

 Cavalry Auditors calculated what it believed to be undercharges by assuming that Foxline Freight Services had provided common carrier services rather than contract carrier services. The potential dispute involved whether the Transportation Agreement actually qualified as a contract carriage arrangement, meaning that distinct needs were addressed, and whether the agreement satisfied requirements for a continuing carriage pact. A central question was the significance of Anderton Electronics’s apparent lack of any obligation to tender a specific number of shipments, even though they ultimately did provide more than six hundred shipments to Foxline Freight Services. Both sides focused heavily on whether the agreement was truly bilateral, whether specialized services beyond those of a common carrier were provided, and whether the formalities and conditions for contract carriage were sufficiently met.

 Arguments supporting Anderton Electronics included that a written transportation arrangement explicitly referenced a specialized set of obligations distinct from mere common carriage. Certain terms allegedly satisfied statutory and regulatory definitions for motor contract carriage, particularly because the agreement gave more favorable payment windows, involved specialized insurance requirements, and was designed to accommodate distinct needs and a specific shipper. Supporters of Anderton Electronics also pointed to relevant regulations under 49 C.F.R. § 1053.1 and decisions such as General Mills, Inc.—Petition for Declaratory Order—Certain Rates and Practices of United Shipping Company, Inc., which they argued allowed for substantial compliance rather than rigid adherence to every detail. The statutory definition at 49 U.S.C. § 10102(15)(B) was invoked to show that dedicating motor vehicle services designed to meet distinct needs of a particular shipper can qualify as contract carriage, provided an unbroken series of shipments was covered by a continuing agreement, even if the agreement did not state an absolute minimum shipment requirement.

 Arguments supporting Cavalry Auditors included the position that for a contract to be recognized as valid under 49 C.F.R. § 1053.1, it must be bilateral, imposing enforceable obligations on each party. In their view, Anderton Electronics had no genuine obligation to commit shipments, meaning the arrangement lacked true mutuality. This raised doubts about whether Foxline Freight Services had actually offered contract carrier services, or if it was merely operating as a common carrier charging negotiated rates. Advocates for Cavalry Auditors also emphasized that the alleged contract did not require Anderton Electronics to send any shipments at all, indicating a unilateral structure. Further, they argued that failing to obligate the shipper to tender at least some quantity of freight might reduce the agreement to a series of individual transactions subject to higher filed tariffs. They cited interpretations of “bilateral” requirements, along with precedent suggesting that, absent a shipper's binding commitment, the arrangement might remain common carriage rather than contract carriage.
