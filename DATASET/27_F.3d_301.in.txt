You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Red Silo, Inc. originally borrowed money from the United States, secured by a mortgage on certain property. To support that loan, two individuals, Henry Johnson and Sarah Johnson, agreed to act as guarantors and pledged to be personally liable if Red Silo, Inc. did not repay the debt. At some point, the United States filed a civil suit to foreclose on the mortgage and to collect from Henry Johnson and Sarah Johnson under their guarantees.

 In its initial complaint, the United States alleged that Red Silo, Inc. had defaulted on the mortgage. Red Silo, Inc. responded by pointing out multiple alleged deficiencies in the complaint, arguing that at least one count failed to meet certain technical standards. The United States responded to some of these points and amended its complaint once, fixing one of the claimed deficiencies. Various deadlines were then set by the district court, but the United States did not meet several of them, and did not request additional time. Meanwhile, Henry Johnson and Sarah Johnson answered the portion of the complaint directed at them without raising major defenses or challenging the sufficiency of that part of the claim.

 After multiple missed deadlines by the United States, the district court required the government to address remaining alleged deficiencies. The district court warned that not complying with the order to amend by a specified date would result in the entire case being dismissed. Later, when that date passed without any new filing by the United States, the district court dismissed all counts in the suit. Several months later, a supervisory attorney for the government explained that an inexperienced attorney had overlooked deadlines and failed to alert superiors. By the time this became known, the district court’s dismissal had been entered. Red Silo, Inc., as the mortgagor, and Henry and Sarah Johnson, as guarantors, were thereby relieved from the suit, according to that dismissal.

 In support of a position favoring Red Silo, Inc., arguments focus on the need for plaintiffs to follow procedural rules and court-ordered deadlines in civil litigation. Cases such as Ball v. Chicago are cited for the principle that parties who repeatedly fail to comply with a court’s instructions risk dismissal. The contention is that the United States had ample opportunity to cure its pleading issues but made no timely effort. Supporters of Red Silo, Inc. note that dismissal is often seen as an appropriate response to negligence in litigation, because orderly process and proper case management require adherence to the court’s schedule. This perspective emphasizes that even when representing the public’s interests, a litigant must manage its attorneys and respect the court’s power to sanction repeated noncompliance. In this view, it is asserted that procedural requirements protect adverse parties from indefinite litigation and preserve judicial resources.

 In support of a position favoring the United States, arguments stress that dismissal can impose undue harshness when less severe remedies might suffice, especially where part of a complaint remains uncontested or is easily curable. Reference is made to precedents stating that sanctions should be proportional to the neglect. The position is that the government’s lapses, though significant, did not irreversibly prejudice Red Silo, Inc. or the guarantors. It is contended that the district court could have ordered lesser sanctions or dismissed only the mortgage foreclosure portion of the suit, thereby allowing the straightforward guarantee claim to remain. Proponents of this approach emphasize that allowing a viable claim to proceed serves the broader interest of justice, especially when public funds and potential revenue are at stake, and where the guarantors never challenged the sufficiency of their part of the litigation. They assert that courts can sanction inattentive counsel, including through monetary penalties, without entirely barring a potentially meritorious claim.
