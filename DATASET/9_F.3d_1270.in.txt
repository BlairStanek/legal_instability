You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Noah Carter was employed by a private company, here called Phoenix Builders, to perform roof replacement work on a building referred to as Structure 200 at a location called Point Maple in Illinois. Phoenix Builders had entered into a written contract with a branch of the United States military to carry out stripping and re-roofing on multiple structures in that area. On one occasion, while Noah Carter was working on the roof at Structure 200, he was not wearing his safety belt and fell, sustaining a severe injury. This incident led to the dispute between Noah Carter and The United States regarding potential responsibility for his injuries.

 According to the contract terms, Phoenix Builders was assigned primary responsibility for taking necessary safety precautions, including the use of safety equipment and adherence to specific standards. Nonetheless, representatives of The United States conducted regular inspections of the worksite to review progress, accepted or rejected materials and methods, and, on at least one occasion, required that certain tasks be performed more safely. The government’s representatives in charge of overseeing the project, such as one individual here called James White, and the contracting officer, here called Michael Green, sometimes issued instructions regarding safety matters. This included halting at least one aspect of the work when it was deemed hazardous. Although the private company bore explicit contractual obligations to ensure worker safety, officials from The United States nonetheless had the authority to insist on compliance with relevant regulations.

 In the course of broader discussions, the case referenced other legal disputes—such as Savic v. United States and Lulich v. Sherwin-Williams Co.—to highlight how courts have handled similar questions about who oversees safety conditions and whether a party has sufficient control of the jobsite. Another theme raised was the distinct considerations that can arise when The United States, rather than a private entity, enters into building or repair contracts. Throughout these considerations, Noah Carter’s injury was central, and the pivotal question became whether The United States had actively retained or exercised enough oversight and control to bear liability.

 One set of arguments emphasizes that a party overseeing construction can, under the Illinois Structural Work Act, be held accountable if it had a form of overarching management or “charge” of the project. Proponents of Noah Carter’s position contend that the authority to stop work for safety reasons, to mandate compliance with federal regulations, and to require additional safety measures demonstrates meaningful control. They invoke the principle that “having charge of” the work is to be interpreted broadly to protect individuals employed in dangerous occupations. They also cite the text of the Federal Tort Claims Act, along with cases such as Larson v. Commonwealth Edison Co. and Kjellesvik v. Commonwealth Edison Co., for the proposition that the power to insist on safe practices is enough to bring The United States squarely within the scope of potential liability. Furthermore, they highlight that The United States’ representatives made regular inspections and even issued directives regarding asbestos handling, showing an ongoing and practical role that influences worker procedures.

 Another set of arguments underlines that Phoenix Builders had been explicitly designated as the party in charge of day-to-day operations and worker safety. Those aligning with The United States point out that retaining only a general right to halt work for contract compliance or to refuse certain materials and methods does not equate to supervision or control over how employees carry out tasks at each moment. They rely on comment c to section 414 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, noting that merely having a right to inspect or to direct overall compliance does not necessarily confer liability for every on-site injury. They also refer to Savic v. United States for the view that the private contractor might remain solely responsible for the safety regimen, especially when the government entity’s role is limited to ensuring contract specifications are met and does not involve detailed oversight of the contractor’s methods. Under this perspective, The United States had no direct involvement in Carter’s decision not to wear a safety belt, so it should not be deemed to have the control that triggers legal responsibility.
