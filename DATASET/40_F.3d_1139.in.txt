You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Devon Wallace is a native of Iran who entered the United States in 1988 on a visitor visa and overstayed. An order to show cause was issued, alleging that he was deportable. Although he conceded deportability, he requested asylum and withholding of deportation, asserting that he feared severe harm if forced to return to Iran. He explained he had once been a high school principal in Iran and was affiliated with a political group originally called the East Freedom Society and later the National Coalition of Iranian Reform.

 According to Devon Wallace, while working as a teacher in Iran, he advised a fourteen-year-old student—renamed here as Leo—not to volunteer for the military effort in the ongoing war. Wallace believed this conversation led the authorities to condemn his political views. Soon afterward, armed individuals appeared at the school intending to arrest him on grounds that he was against the government. Wallace fled Iran soon after, ultimately traveling to France and then on to the United States. His immediate family remained abroad; he alleges that anti-government figures were targeted even beyond Iranian soil.

 Several witnesses provided statements or testimony supporting the idea that Devon Wallace was on a list of political dissidents wanted by the Iranian regime. Sam White and Jim Green, who claimed to have been part of Iran’s military or police apparatus, indicated Wallace would be arrested if he returned. Further, a letter from Paul West, said to be a former Iranian military colonel, and an affidavit from Tom Blue, a onetime student of Wallace, both asserted that Wallace appeared on a “wanted” list due to his political beliefs. Finally, a communication from River Group (formerly the East Freedom Society’s successor organization) stated that individuals who had opposed the current Iranian government would face severe consequences if returned.

 Those supporting the Board of Immigration Appeals’ position present multiple legal arguments. They point to 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42), underscoring that an applicant must demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution tied to a protected ground such as political opinion. They invoke Kapcia v. INS and INS v. Elias-Zacarias for the premise that an arrest tied to possibly illegal conduct may not necessarily qualify as persecution on account of political opinion. They suggest that, even assuming some animosity by the authorities, there is no compelling proof that Wallace was singled out for anything other than wrongdoing under domestic statutes proscribing interference with wartime efforts. Citing additional precedent, they argue that legitimate prosecution—even if harsh—does not transform into political persecution when a sovereign is enforcing facially valid laws. Finally, they rely on guidance that the burden of showing a probability of real political persecution, rather than ordinary prosecution, remains on the asylum applicant.

 Those supporting Devon Wallace present equally robust counterarguments. They maintain that under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) and cases like Blanco-Lopez v. INS, what appears to be government prosecution may, in fact, be persecution if grounded in a person’s beliefs. They argue that Wallace’s disapproval of a child’s involvement in an armed conflict was itself a political stance, implicating freedom of conscience and dissent. They insist no legitimate laws had been shown to exist in Iran mandating a fourteen-year-old to fight, so any supposed prosecution would be illegitimate—merely a pretext for punishing Wallace’s opposition to the regime. Wallace’s supporters cite international conventions, explaining that compelling or allowing minors to partake in armed conflict contravenes recognized humanitarian principles, thus making Wallace’s exhortation a protected form of political expression. By highlighting his membership in groups critical of the regime, they conclude he would almost certainly face persecution if returned, satisfying both the “well-founded fear” and the higher “clear probability” thresholds recognized in Kapcia v. INS and related decisions.
