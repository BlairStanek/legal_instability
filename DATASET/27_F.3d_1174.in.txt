You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Winston was charged in a two-count indictment with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, marijuana under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, and with money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1966(a)(1)(A)(C). He had worked in music promotion in Lakeview, Michigan, and also promoted a hair salon owned by Carson. Carson later faced drug charges and began cooperating with the Government, eventually cooperating in a controlled purchase of cocaine from Winston that led to Winston’s arrest. Investigators discovered that Winston had been transporting marijuana to Michigan and had used a wire service, here called Northeastern Telegraph, to send drug proceeds to Carter in California in exchange for heroin. Winston made many transfers, supplied other individuals with narcotics, and pooled funds to purchase drugs at a discount.

 Shortly before trial, Winston entered a guilty plea to both charges. However, within days of his scheduled sentencing, Winston moved to withdraw the plea. He maintained that he had misunderstood the consequences of pleading guilty, specifically claiming that he had not been fully informed of a mandatory minimum sentence that could apply. Winston also argued that he lacked a complete understanding of the money laundering charge and had felt pressured to plead guilty out of concern that his lawyer, Gray, was unprepared for trial.

 In determining Winston’s guideline range, the district court concluded that the conspiracy involved more than 100 kilograms of marijuana or the equivalent amount of heroin, a finding Winston disputed. Winston also challenged the court’s classification of him as a manager or supervisor, asserting that he simply facilitated transactions for others due to personal debts and drug dependency. Additionally, Winston contended that he should receive a greater reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. He argued that he had only belatedly learned of a possible mandatory minimum prison term and believed that he had been wrongly led to think there was no risk of such a sentence.

 In support of the view that Winston’s current conviction and sentencing posture should remain as charged, the Government relies on the district court’s authority under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, contending that any omissions in detailing mandatory minimums did not prejudice Winston because he was informed of a maximum sentence significantly exceeding five years. The Government cites decisions such as United States v. Wolak and United States v. Syal, emphasizing that a failure to discuss mandatory minimums can be deemed harmless if the defendant was already aware of a high possible maximum. The Government further points to the volume of drug proceeds transferred via Northeastern Telegraph, Winston’s admission that he arranged group purchases of heroin, and his cross-country efforts to bring marijuana into Michigan. These facts, the Government argues, establish Winston’s supervisory role under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, as he exercised decision-making authority, involved others in his ventures, and directed interstate drug movements. The Government also cites precedent indicating that a managerial enhancement can apply to someone coordinating significant transactions, regardless of whether the participant exercised control over others who were higher or lower in status.

 In support of Winston’s position that his guilty plea should be withdrawn or set aside, it is asserted that Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure imposes a clear duty on the court to advise a pleading defendant about any mandatory minimum sentences. Winston argues that he was affirmatively led to think there would be no mandatory minimum, undercutting any attempt to treat the omission as harmless. In reliance on rulings such as United States v. Hourihan and United States v. Jaramillo-Suarez, Winston contends that harmless error cannot apply where a defendant lacked independent knowledge of the mandatory minimum and was misled into waiving the right to a full jury trial. Winston also disputes the factual basis for including the alleged amounts of heroin in the conspiracy tally, maintaining that certain purchases were for personal use rather than distribution. Coupled with his contention that he was never truly a manager, Winston argues that the evidence does not fairly support a leadership enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1. Finally, Winston believes that even if he were guilty of illegal conduct, a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 is warranted because he offered cooperation, accepted primary responsibility upon his initial admission of guilt, and never intended to impede any Government investigation.
