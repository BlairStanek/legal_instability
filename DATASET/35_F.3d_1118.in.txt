You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, Alex Carter was injured while diving from a sawed-off tree stump into waters of a lake created and managed for flood control in Illinois. The lake, referred to here as Longview Lake, was formed several decades earlier for flood control, and a beach area was later added at a nearby campground, called Hidden Valley Campground, to encourage recreation. At some point, a dead tree located in the water near that beach was partially removed: it was cut down but left standing several feet above the water. This remaining stump was commonly used by swimmers as an informal diving platform. Alex Carter, visiting Hidden Valley Campground with family, placed makeshift steps on the stump and dove from it, only to be severely injured upon contacting additional submerged remnants of the tree below the water’s surface.

 Following the accident, divers hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers examined and removed the stump and other submerged debris. At the time of the accident, a designated swimming zone in that section of Longview Lake was marked off by floating pipe, but Alex Carter dove from a location some distance beyond the marked area. It was alleged that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which administered the property, had left hazards in place outside the marked zone despite being aware that swimmers often moved beyond the delineated boundary.

 In response, Alex Carter brought a lawsuit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, alleging that negligence in managing the recreational aspects of Longview Lake caused his injuries. The United States invoked protections under the Flood Control Act of 1928, among other arguments, contending that activities relating to flood control frequently shield the government from liability. As part of the proceedings, both the factual background of Longview Lake’s flood control features and the lake’s multiple recreational uses were examined. Discussion also arose about the extent to which water-level fluctuations or other flood control operations may have contributed to the submerged hazard that injured Alex Carter.

 On one side, there is an argument that Alex Carter should prevail because the hazard encountered in these flood control waters was not sufficiently or necessarily linked to any distinct flood control feature. This view emphasizes that concealed obstacles in a popular recreational area could be anticipated and guarded against just as they would be at any lake offering swimming opportunities, regardless of whether the lake’s primary purpose was flood control. Proponents of this position assert that a straightforward application of the Federal Tort Claims Act holds the United States accountable when its agents are allegedly negligent in making recreational spaces safe. They highlight cases interpreting the Flood Control Act of 1928 to mean that immunity applies only when the flood control activities themselves actually cause or increase the probability of the specific injury. Reference is made to precedents like United States v. James where the Supreme Court addressed water releases for flood control, distinguishing that scenario from instances in which the government’s failure to address a known hazard is arguably unrelated to flood control operations.

 On the other side, there is an argument that the United States should prevail because any injury in waters that are part of a federal flood control system is effectively within the scope of the Flood Control Act of 1928, which broadly immunizes the government from liability for damages arising out of flood waters. According to this position, the fact that the lake was created and is maintained primarily for flood control is decisive. Advocates of this view rely on the clear language of the Flood Control Act and on cases such as United States v. James, stressing that water within a flood control project is afforded broad statutory protection against tort liability. They contend that fluctuations in the water level or underwater obstructions are integral to flood control operations, and that these features cannot be separated from the overarching flood control purpose. They further argue that because the site of the alleged negligence is in flood control waters, the Flood Control Act and associated precedents necessarily foreclose recovery under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
