You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


At the time relevant to this matter, Alex Parker was incarcerated at the Indiana Reformatory located in Redwood. Morgan White was one of the officials involved in investigating or overseeing the disciplinary process. According to the available record, Parker and another inmate, Jacob Frost, occupied neighboring cells shortly after Frost was moved there in early July. Parker felt uneasy about this assignment and raised concerns that being housed next to Frost might lead to conflict.

 Parker later received a note from Frost that demanded Parker come to Frost’s cell and engage in sexual activity. The note included a threat that harm could result if Parker failed to comply. During a breakfast period, Frost allegedly entered Parker’s cell and attempted to assault him physically. Parker, in a reported effort to stop this attack, struck Frost multiple times with a commissary-issued pot that was not heated. Another inmate, David Mora, intervened when he heard a struggle, separated the two, and helped force Frost out of Parker’s cell.

 In the aftermath, Parker, Frost, and Mora each faced disciplinary action. A Conduct Adjustment Board, composed of Noah Adams, Sam Roberts, and Toby Carter, heard the case. Parker maintained that his actions did not constitute a rule violation because he was acting solely in self-defense. Under the policies in effect, the Board found Parker guilty of battery and levied a term of segregation, which was then suspended. The disciplinary findings revealed that self-defense was considered only as a factor that might mitigate punishment, rather than as a complete defense.

 In challenging Parker’s position, Morgan White has contended that a restriction on claiming self-defense as a complete defense serves important government objectives within the prison. One argument is that a strict rule banning complete exoneration on self-defense grounds furthers legitimate penological interests by deterring all violence, since inmates cannot simply argue they were protecting themselves if they choose to engage physically. White’s position relies on interpretations of constitutional law suggesting that incarceration inherently entails significant limitations on personal liberties. White cites precedents such as Wolff v. McDonnell in support of the principle that prisoners do not enjoy the full array of rights available in conventional criminal trials. White further argues that, under Turner v. Safley, a policy restricting the recognition of self-defense can be considered reasonably related to safety and order. The reasoning emphasizes that prison officials must be able to craft rules to maintain internal security in an environment where conflicts are frequent and difficult to monitor. Supporters of this position also argue that the presence of a limited acknowledgment of self-defense in mitigation helps address fairness concerns, as it allows the individual circumstances to be taken into account without wholly encouraging more violence.

 In response, Alex Parker’s primary arguments stress that, when someone is violently threatened by another inmate, being denied a full self-defense claim leaves them with no lawful means of protecting themselves. Parker’s position focuses on the assertion that a fundamental aspect of personal security is at stake when one must choose between submitting to severe harm or facing disciplinary sanctions. Parker points to certain statements in legal scholarship and some judicial observations, which suggest that eliminating self-defense in its entirety contravenes basic principles of fairness. Parker also points to the nature of prison life, where individuals alleging that officials or staff are unresponsive to pleas for protection might be left helpless against assaults from other inmates. By referencing doctrines that underline the necessity of at least some baseline acknowledgment of self-defense, Parker insists that a complete ban endangers prisoners who rely on immediate self-help in genuine emergencies. Parker maintains such circumstances implicate significant liberty interests, and that policies must allow full exoneration when an inmate reasonably believes safety or even survival is at serious risk.
