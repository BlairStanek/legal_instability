You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Ms. White is the daughter of Mr. White, who served in Vietnam and passed away in December 1987 from a service-related heart condition. At that time, Ms. White was 18 years old and enrolled full time at Red Rock University. She later submitted an application for financial assistance under the Restored Entitlement Program for Survivors (REPS) more than a year after her father’s death, seeking monthly payments dating back to December 1987.

 The Department of Veterans Affairs granted Ms. White’s request for REPS assistance beginning from the time she filed her application, rather than from her father’s date of death. Ms. White wanted those payments retroactive to December 1987, arguing that she met all requirements and should receive REPS payments for every month she satisfied the statutory criteria.

 The Board of Veterans Appeals relied on provisions in 38 C.F.R. § 3.812(f) that limited how far back Ms. White could receive retroactive payments, noting that her claim had been filed more than eleven months after she first became eligible. The question for both parties became whether these regulatory time constraints align with the statute that established REPS or whether they go beyond what the law, as written by Congress, permits.

 Those supporting Ms. White’s position contend that the governing statute says the Department of Veterans Affairs “shall pay each month” if specific eligibility requirements are met, without imposing a time-specific filing condition for retroactive relief. They point out that references to the Social Security Act in the statute only relate to calculating how much is due, not to restricting when such claims must be submitted. They further highlight legislative materials indicating that REPS was intended to restore benefits that would have otherwise been curtailed and maintain that the plain text of the statute does not authorize extra procedural barriers.

 Those supporting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs emphasize that the statute is silent regarding any explicit span for retroactive payments, creating space for administrative regulations to impose reasonable deadlines. They argue that Congress intended to model REPS on Social Security provisions, including the filing limits found in section 202(j). According to this viewpoint, deference should be given to the Department’s interpretation under Chevron principles, since the regulation is seen as a permissible way to fill in the gaps left by the statute and keep REPS benefits consistent with underlying Social Security rules.
