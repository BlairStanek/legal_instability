You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, Joseph Parks had authorized his son, Adam Parks, to make monetary gifts on Joseph’s behalf. Near the end of one year, Adam wrote checks to himself, his spouse, and other relatives, each in the amount of a set sum. Those checks, drawn on Joseph’s personal bank account, were delivered to the donees late in the year and deposited without delay. The bank, however, did not actually process the checks and remove funds from Joseph’s account until the first days of the following year.

 The Commissioner of Internal Revenue later inspected Joseph’s estate filings. The estate return included the gifts made via checks, and a question arose as to whether those gifts legally fell in the year of the checks’ delivery or in the following year when the bank honored the checks. The Commissioner focused on the fact that Joseph, at the time the checks were issued, still retained a theoretical ability to stop payment until the bank finally processed them. This retention of control became central to the dispute about when, for tax purposes, the gifts were completed.

 Joseph died more than a year after these checks were issued and deposited. By that time, the Commissioner had taken the position that if the checks did not qualify as completed gifts in the earlier year, they should be classified as having been completed the following year, thus affecting the total amount of taxable gifts counted toward Joseph’s estate obligations. The estate argued that these checks were properly considered completed gifts in the earlier year, supporting its calculations on the estate’s return.

 One set of arguments cites statutory provisions emphasizing the donor’s intent to make an irrevocable transfer. Under these arguments, because Joseph had manifested clear donative intent and because the checks were delivered and promptly deposited, the gifts allegedly fit within provisions such as 26 U.S.C. § 2503(b), which provides annual exclusions from the gift tax. Supporters of this view note that certain holdings, including those in Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner and Estate of Belcher v. Commissioner, recognize a principle sometimes referred to as a relation-back idea—asserting that once checks are given unconditionally and subsequently paid, the transaction may be deemed to have occurred, for tax purposes, when the donor parted with them. They rely on the notion that swift deposit, lack of any intervening event such as the donor’s death before clearing, and the absence of any arrangement to delay or revoke the gifts all favor treating the transfer as completed at delivery.

 Another set of arguments emphasizes that, under 26 C.F.R. § 25.2511-2(b) and related authorities, an inter vivos gift is incomplete as long as the donor can still exercise dominion over the funds. Precedents, such as Estate of Dillingham v. Commissioner, McCarthy v. United States, and Estate of Gagliardi v. Commissioner, suggest there is inherent risk in deeming checks completed at delivery because a donor retains the power to stop payment until the check is honored. Such arguments stress that the plain language of the regulations declares a gift to be complete only when the donor has surrendered all power to redirect or revoke it; since a donor retains the ability to halt payment, any transfer of funds via personal check remains conditional until the bank certifies it by deducting the amount from the donor’s account. These authorities point to the risk of manipulating the timing of gifts if the mere act of delivery is regarded as equivalent to final payment.
