You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On a date in the early 1990s, Michael Diaz was deported from the United States. Soon after, he attempted to reenter the United States by passing through a border patrol checkpoint. According to official documents, he claimed to be a United States citizen and provided no identification. A search revealed identifying materials connected to him under a particular name that led border patrol agents to discover prior deportation records and a history of criminal convictions. Charged under 8 U.S.C. § 1326, he moved to challenge the use of his prior deportation on grounds that he had not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal during that earlier proceeding. The district court heard his arguments in a pretrial phase.

 The earlier deportation proceeding took place in a group setting. There were multiple individuals facing removal, and the immigration judge addressed them all together, explaining that any person could appeal the decision if he wished to do so. The record indicates that the judge asked if everyone understood the decision, then explained the possibility of an appeal or preserving the right to appeal. The judge invited anyone who wanted more information, or who wished to appeal, to stand up. No one from the group stood. As a result, the record showed a collective agreement to proceed with immediate deportation. Michael Diaz later argued that this process pressured everyone to remain silent and that there was no specific inquiry about whether he personally wished to waive or exercise his right to appeal.

 Additional facts include that Michael Diaz’s criminal record stretched back several years and included various theft- and drug-related offenses. Because of his history, there were disputed questions about whether he could have obtained any form of relief or whether an appeal would have been futile. It further emerged that Michael Diaz had family members legally residing in the United States, although no records showed any filed petitions to adjust his status. Both sides focused attention on whether the earlier group proceeding deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to seek review and on whether he was prejudiced by any flaws in that setting.

 In support of the first party’s position, several arguments were advanced. It was contended that 8 U.S.C. § 1326 prosecutions rely appropriately on facially valid removal orders unless a defendant proves both a constitutionally significant flaw in the earlier process and concrete prejudice. Citing cases such as United States v. Proa-Tovar and United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, this side emphasized that administrative proceedings need only provide notice of the right to appeal for waivers to be enforceable. It was further argued that standardized group procedures can still furnish due process if the judge offers an option to raise individual concerns. From this perspective, because Michael Diaz received oral explanations about the right to appeal—along with a chance to stand and protest—no further one-on-one questioning is strictly required to constitute a proper waiver, and no automatic inference of invalidity is justified. Moreover, this side claimed that any minor defects in the hearing would not matter unless Michael Diaz could show he was actually eligible for relief or would have benefitted from additional review.

 In support of the second party’s position, a different set of arguments was presented. This party stressed that due process should mandate a clear, individualized inquiry into whether someone truly wishes to waive a statutory right to appellate review. Citing United States v. Mendoza-Lopez and related authority, it was argued that when a prior removal order is used in a criminal prosecution, special judicial scrutiny is warranted to ensure the alien had a fair chance to challenge removal. From this perspective, a “mass silent waiver” does not affirmatively show the individual’s knowing and considered decision, especially under circumstances that may lead detainees to feel inhibited from speaking. In that view, automatically treating the group’s non-response as a valid waiver risks coercion and confusion, depriving individuals of meaningful appellate review. Consequently, this side maintained that a strict approach to determining whether the right of appeal was truly waived is essential, and that unless there is a robust inquiry demonstrating an intentional and voluntary election, the use of such an order should be disallowed in a criminal case.
