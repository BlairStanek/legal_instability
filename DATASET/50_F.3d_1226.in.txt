You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Hassan was incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution in Harbridge, Pennsylvania, when a large disturbance took place. He claimed that he was assaulted by multiple guards, including Jordan and other individuals, in the days following the disturbance. He asserted that this occurred while he was housed in a particular restricted unit sometimes referred to as D block. On at least one occasion, he stated he was handcuffed when the guards used physical force against him. The guards denied any improper treatment and contended that Hassan’s allegations were unsubstantiated.

 During the trial, Hassan introduced various pieces of evidence to show injuries, including testimony from a cleric named Rashid Ali who said he noticed bruises around Hassan’s neck and chest. Rashid Ali had once been employed by the institution but was no longer working there. The precise reason for his departure was disputed. Defense counsel sought to question Rashid Ali about his termination, believing it might show bias against the guards. Hassan’s side argued that delving into the specific details would distract the jury and was unnecessary for credibility purposes. This disagreement over the limits of cross-examination became one central point of contention.

 Another dispute centered on the manner in which jurors were asked to determine who was liable for using force, as well as who might have only stood by or approved its use. Hassan’s allegations included claims that Jordan and others either participated directly in administering physical force or knowingly allowed it. There was debate about whether Hassan had consistently alleged that Jordan physically assaulted him, or whether Hassan sometimes suggested Jordan merely permitted others to strike him. In addition, there were questions about whether the jury should be permitted to consider separate liability theories—personal involvement versus approval of force—if those theories were not clearly set out before deliberations began.

 In support of Jordan’s position, it was argued that a thorough cross-examination of Rashid Ali was necessary to reveal the possibility of bias and to ensure the jury would be fully informed when evaluating the cleric’s statements. Citing the principle that jurors must have sufficient information to assess a witness’s motives, Jordan’s supporters insisted that preventing more extensive questioning deprived the factfinder of crucial evidence regarding Rashid Ali’s credibility. Additionally, they contended that if a jury instruction on the permissible use of force had fully reflected that guards may lawfully employ physical measures in good faith to restore discipline, the factfinder could have more easily accepted a reasonable interpretation consistent with the guards’ version of events. Finally, Jordan’s side maintained that the jury should not have been permitted to assign liability on a new theory—that someone merely watched or approved the force—if the only earlier theory had been that Jordan and others personally engaged in physical harm.

 In support of Hassan’s position, it was argued that the district court’s decision to limit questioning about Rashid Ali’s employment history properly balanced the need to reveal potential bias against the risk of creating a confusing side-issue. They contended that mentioning a witness’s termination from the institution was enough for jurors to gauge possible motives, without dragging the trial into collateral disputes. On the question of the force used, Hassan’s advocates argued that any instruction should be framed to focus on whether the guards acted with malicious intent, and that retroactive justifications should not override evidence of unnecessary harm. Finally, Hassan’s side maintained that, if the evidence at trial implicitly or explicitly showed that a guard could be responsible by failing to intervene or by silently endorsing improper conduct, the jurors had adequate grounds to hold that guard accountable under a broader standard of liability for excessive force. Such a conclusion, they asserted, was consistent with longstanding precedent ensuring constitutional protections in custodial settings.
