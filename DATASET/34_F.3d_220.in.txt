You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The dispute centers on a set of amendments called S.B. 235 to the Virginia Petroleum Products Franchise Act. One party, Baxter Energy Company, is a refiner and distributor of petroleum products that uses various types of service station arrangements with franchisees. S.B. 235 restricts certain provisions in agreements between such refiners and their franchisees, including terms about station operations, purchase or sales requirements, lease renewals, rental rates, and the number of stations a dealer may control. The Attorney General of Virginia enforces these amendments and insists that they are legitimate regulations within the state’s authority.

 Baxter Energy Company contends that after it adjusted its station franchise agreements to comply with S.B. 235, it experienced adverse financial effects. It points to declines in profitability and alleged disruptions to its operational model, as well as difficulties in uniformly applying its corporate standards. Baxter Energy Company further claims that several of its usual contractual terms, which it previously regarded as important for brand consistency, are prohibited under S.B. 235.

 The Attorney General of Virginia characterizes S.B. 235 as a lawful measure aimed at protecting franchisees from what are portrayed as unfair operational demands and unpredictable economic burdens. According to this view, aspects such as hours of operation, rental rates, and maximum numbers of stations per dealer all fall within the state’s right to regulate business dealings for public benefit. In this vein, the Attorney General also maintains that the statutory requirements neither undermine federal uniformity in franchise termination policies nor improperly interfere with broader federal trademark or contract interests.

 Baxter Energy Company asserts that federal law, particularly the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), was intended to provide a nationwide framework that sets out permissible bases and procedures for ending or not renewing petroleum franchise relationships. It contends that the PMPA’s language broadly addresses circumstances in which either party can walk away from the franchise, so that any restriction on contractual terms used as conditions or triggers for termination would necessarily conflict with the PMPA. Baxter Energy Company also invokes the notion that protections for its marks under the Lanham Act could be jeopardized if it is unable to impose certain contractual requirements designed to preserve the quality and reputation of its brand. Lastly, it points to constitutional provisions, including the Contract and Takings Clauses, arguing that S.B. 235 unduly impairs its ability to manage its business and to realize the full value of its property and contractual rights.

 The Attorney General of Virginia contends that the PMPA, while comprehensive in laying out reasons and methods for termination or nonrenewal, does not directly speak to many of the substantive terms addressed by S.B. 235. On this view, S.B. 235 involves regulations over the content of franchise agreements—such as rental arrangement guidelines, permissible operating hours, or the number of sites permitted—rather than allowing or disallowing terminations. The Attorney General underscores that there is a long history of state regulation in the sphere of contract law and consumer protection, which calls for a presumption against preemption absent explicit intent from Congress. This perspective also discounts any conflict with the Lanham Act by asserting that a refiner’s ability to maintain brand quality need not depend on quotas, extended hours, or limits on how many stations a single dealer may run. Finally, the Attorney General disputes claims of constitutional violations, asserting that S.B. 235 reasonably advances public welfare objectives without improperly infringing upon Baxter Energy Company’s contractual or property interests.
