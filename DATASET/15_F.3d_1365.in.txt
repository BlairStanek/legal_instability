You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Harvey Martin, having worked part-time for many years at National Delivery Corp., applied for a full-time driver position. Several years before his original hire, he had been arrested in Harper Hills after being found in a field alongside another person who possessed a marijuana cigarette. He later pleaded guilty to “loitering” under a local ordinance, paid a fine, and believed he had no criminal record. Not long after, he filled out employment applications at National Delivery Corp. stating he had never been convicted of a crime.

 When Martin sought the full-time driver role at National Delivery Corp., a criminal history check suggested he had a “controlled substance article” violation. National Delivery Corp. discharged him, citing “dishonesty” on the applications or another “extreme seriousness” violation. Martin filed a grievance through Guild of Shippers, Local 99, which had a collective bargaining agreement with National Delivery Corp. The agreement provided that an unresolved grievance “shall” be submitted for further steps, which can include a state-level committee review.

 A representative from Guild of Shippers, Local 99 (whom Martin gave documentation about his arrest) brought Martin’s dispute to an initial meeting with National Delivery Corp. When the employer declined to reinstate Martin, the representative suggested Martin accept a resignation, but Martin refused and asked for an appeal. The representative later indicated there was nothing further to do and considered the grievance closed. Martin argued that the guild had assured him of assistance but ceased its efforts prematurely, whereas the guild maintained it had attempted to resolve the issue and believed further steps would not succeed.

 In support of Martin’s position, lengthy references were made to Vaca v. Sipes and its requirement that a union must not ignore a potentially meritorious grievance or handle it in a perfunctory or arbitrary manner. Martin’s arguments emphasized that the collective bargaining agreement language used “shall” in describing further review; that no final decision or settlement with the employer was actually reached; and that a person should not be punished for an unclear or unknowing misstatement on an application, given that dishonesty often demands proof of intent. Martin also invoked the principle that a significant track record at National Delivery Corp. and other mitigating facts made the decision to halt the grievance process questionable under precedent like Poole v. Budd Co. and that a union’s broad discretion still cannot encompass conduct so far outside the “wide range of reasonableness” established in Air Line Pilots Ass’n v. O’Neill.

 In support of Guild of Shippers, Local 99, references were made to decisions such as Whitten v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., confirming that a union is not obligated to proceed with every grievance and may refrain from pursuing one it deems unwinnable or contrary to the broader interests of the workforce. The guild maintained that, once it learned the employer had a strong policy about any material discrepancy on hiring documents, it had broad leeway to resolve or even abandon the grievance if the evidence suggested little chance of overturning the discharge. The guild also stressed there is no absolute legal obligation to exhaust every administrative step under Vaca v. Sipes so long as the union has, in good faith, examined the issues and determined that advancing further would be futile or unproductive. Finally, it was argued that its decision-making process arose from extensive experience with similar cases; that an employee’s acknowledgment of having answered incorrectly on official documents supported the employer’s action; and that, under long-established doctrine, neither mistaken judgment nor lack of success at persuading the employer translates into a duty-of-fair-representation breach.
