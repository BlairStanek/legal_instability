You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Carpenter was charged with two felony counts for mailing threatening communications under 18 U.S.C. § 876. He wrote two letters containing hateful and insulting language, one directed toward a chapter of the National Progress League and the other addressed to members of a group called Daybreak Assembly. He used the return address “Riverton W.U.C.” (referring to White Unity Circle) and a Riverton post office box registered in his own name. The FBI later confronted Carpenter when the handwriting and return address were linked to him.

 Carpenter initially pleaded guilty to one of the felony counts and one misdemeanor count of interfering with housing rights under 42 U.S.C. § 3631(a). The misdemeanor charge asserted that the office of the National Progress League in Riverton doubled as the home of its regional leader. The presentence report recommended a certain guidelines range and considered whether Carpenter’s actions might qualify for a four-level reduction based on U.S.S.G. § 2A6.1(b)(2). Because it appeared that pleading guilty to both felonies might lead to a lower range, Carpenter sought to withdraw his first plea and plead anew to the two felonies instead.

 In the subsequent proceedings, Carpenter argued that his conduct was the product of a single episode of drunken behavior lacking deliberation, and that, under U.S.S.G. § 2A6.1(b)(2), a reduction in offense level should apply. Additionally, there was dispute over certain juvenile adjudications in Carpenter’s record, including whether a continuation of an earlier juvenile wardship should be counted for criminal history points. There was also debate about whether Carpenter had been put on sufficient notice before sentencing that his bid for a reduction under these guidelines provisions might fail. Finally, Carpenter alleged that he had not been fully apprised of the risk that pleading guilty to two felonies could result in a heavier sentence than he originally anticipated.

 In support of the Government’s position, various arguments were raised emphasizing that Carpenter’s threats were deliberately mailed to separate victim groups, each chosen for its distinct racial or religious traits. The Government cited 18 U.S.C. § 876, arguing that Carpenter took deliberate steps in locating addresses, affixing postage, and depositing letters in different mail receptacles. References to cases like McAninch, Fine, and Pacione were likewise raised, as was the commentary to U.S.S.G. § 2A6.1, to show that multiple, separately directed threats might not be treated as a single impulse under the guidelines. The Government also relied on precedent allowing use of certain prior juvenile adjudications for calculating criminal history when a finding of guilt was made beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the Government maintained that federal procedures under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3 adequately satisfied notice requirements regarding sentencing disagreements.

 In support of Carpenter’s position, arguments were presented that both letters arose from an impulse of angry drunkenness and had been composed in a short time span—as Carpenter returned home at night, wrote the letters in a single burst, and mailed them before sleeping. Carpenter invoked the spirit of a “single instance” reduction under U.S.S.G. § 2A6.1(b)(2), pointing to Pacione for the proposition that multiple statements of threat within a short period may still qualify as one impulsive act. Carpenter further contended that his communications were crude, reflected little rational planning, and exhibited none of the extended deliberation that the guideline commentary or cases like Bellrichard might require. Concerning juvenile adjudications, Carpenter asserted that simply continuing his wardship did not constitute a new adjudication of guilt. He also advocated that Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) mandates clearer judicial notice before accepting a change of plea in circumstances suggesting that a sentencing outcome could be substantially higher than originally expected.
