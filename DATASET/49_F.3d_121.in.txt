You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Devon Price pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing a firearm in December 1992 in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Years earlier, he had been convicted in a state court in January 1988 of a felony involving armed robbery. As part of his eventual federal sentencing for the firearm offense, an issue arose over whether a short custody period unrelated to a subsequent revocation hearing should count toward certain criminal history factors under the federal guidelines.

 Back in January 1983, Devon Price originally received a nine-year state sentence, commencing from his 1982 arrest date, for multiple crimes. He served five years before being released on parole in 1987. Not long after, he was arrested for burglary and trespass in Uptown City. These arrests led to a warrant for an alleged parole violation in May 1988, which went unserved for approximately four years. Eventually, in May 1992, the unserved warrant resulted in Price’s detention for 24 days pending a parole revocation hearing, even though his full parole term had seemingly run in July 1991.

 At the hearing, the parole commission found Devon Price responsible for certain violations, but it did not revoke his parole or impose further prison time. The 24-day custody period involved Price being housed in a correctional facility. The debate in court focused on whether that period counted as continued imprisonment on the original sentence or was instead only a pre-hearing administrative detention. The timing of these events was considered crucial, given that the new firearm offense had taken place less than two years after this 24-day stint in custody if it was to be treated as part of a sentence.

 One argument is that the pre-revocation custody should not be classified as imprisonment on a sentence. Citing the guidelines’ structure, proponents of this view point out that time spent awaiting a revocation hearing was never included in a formal revocation of parole or a reimposed term. They invoke U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(k), which addresses adding to a sentence only after parole is actually revoked and additional imprisonment is imposed, and they note that no subsection directly calls for treating a pre-hearing stay in confinement as part of the underlying sentence. Emphasizing policy concerns, they stress that counting every short-term detention, especially when parole is not revoked, could unfairly boost criminal history scores for mere administrative holds rather than actual re-incarceration.

 The contrary position contends that because Devon Price was still under the same nine-year sentence, the 24 days in prison should be treated as imprisonment on that sentence. Drawing on Maryland law, this view underscores that a parolee remains in legal custody throughout the original term, and any return to confinement for a parole issue is part of the same custodial sentence. This side also highlights that the basis for the detention was Price’s alleged missteps while on parole, suggesting that recent and repeated criminal conduct is what the guidelines seek to address with heightened criminal history considerations. They further maintain that whether parole was ultimately revoked does not negate the fact that Price was incarcerated on the same sentence for violating conditions tied to that existing sentence, placing him squarely within the criteria for an enhanced calculation under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e).
