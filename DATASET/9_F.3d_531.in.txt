You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Kevin Parker and Jordan Lee were both charged with involvement in a plan to obtain and distribute marijuana across state lines. According to testimony by others, Jordan Lee and another individual traveled from Maple City, Ohio to Redwood City, Arizona at Kevin Parker’s request, where they allegedly provided cash in exchange for marijuana. They then drove back to Ohio and, based on the statements in the record, delivered the marijuana to Kevin Parker. At a later point, Jordan Lee was stopped by law enforcement for a seat belt violation while driving with Kevin Parker’s relative, which led to the discovery of a substantial sum of cash in the car. Both were eventually released. Additional accounts indicated that Kevin Parker engaged in multiple arrangements to send individuals between Ohio and Arizona to pick up marijuana, including taped or concealed currency transfers, followed by delivery of narcotics.

 Evidence presented described large sums of money provided to a person identified in the record as Robin Carter in Arizona. Witnesses recounted how Kevin Parker organized trips, supplied travel money, and instructed couriers on payment to Robin Carter. The record also included statements about hidden marijuana in vehicle panels, taped money strapped to individuals to avoid detection, and a final incident where one driver was stopped in Tennessee, resulting in a seizure of more than 100 pounds of marijuana. Shortly thereafter, Kevin Parker, Jordan Lee, and another individual allegedly met that courier in an Ohio hotel to receive the latest batch. Monitored conversations during this hotel meeting reportedly revealed discussions of transporting marijuana, handing over cash, and needing scales for weighing. Both Kevin Parker and Jordan Lee were then taken into custody.

 A related issue in the case concerned how the sentencing court should handle sums of cash seized at different points in the investigation, especially whether such cash should be converted into a corresponding quantity of marijuana for sentencing purposes. The record showed varied testimony about the possible per-pound value of marijuana. The district court imposed particular calculations for the cash-to-marijuana conversions, and those conversions influenced the amounts of marijuana used to determine sentencing ranges. Kevin Parker and Jordan Lee each challenged various aspects of the charges, the handling of evidence, the admission of co-conspirators’ statements, and the method of calculating drug quantities from seized currency.

 In support of Kevin Parker’s position, arguments emphasized statutory language requiring proof of a “financial transaction” when pursuing certain offenses, contending that physically transporting or concealing currency within the United States does not necessarily constitute such a transaction. These arguments pointed to the definitions found in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c), which include specific terms like “purchase” or “transfer” and focus on exchanges that change the nature of proceeds or promote further wrongdoing in a tangible way. Advocates for Kevin Parker relied on narrower interpretations in certain judicial precedents, contending that mere movement of cash, even if concealed, does not meet the threshold of exchange or transformation that the statute requires. They further argued that separate statutory provisions address transporting currency across national borders, implying that domestic movement of funds alone is not encompassed by the definition in question. On the issue of drug quantity calculations, Kevin Parker’s arguments stressed that any conversion of currency into a marijuana equivalent must be supported by concrete, consistent evidence rather than speculative or arbitrary rates.

 On behalf of the Government, arguments focused on the broader reading of “transaction” to include situations where the movement of currency is integral to the continued operation of illegal drug distribution. Citing the definitions in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c), the Government contended that “transfer” or “delivery” of funds affecting interstate commerce should be understood to include handing over large sums of cash for securing additional supplies of narcotics. Under this view, concealing money and physically transporting it to complete a deal amounted to an act that furthered unlawful activity, satisfying the statute’s elements. The Government’s position also highlighted that the statute reaches not only attempts to disguise the proceeds but also efforts to use those proceeds to sustain the criminal conspiracy. Regarding the conversion of seized currency into a quantity of marijuana for sentencing purposes, the Government argued that courts should be allowed broad discretion to estimate drug amounts based on cash payments, since that method accurately reflects the overall scale of criminal conduct and aligns with sentencing guidelines that permit leveraging available financial evidence to approximate drug volume.
