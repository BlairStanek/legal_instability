You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Michael Morgan was indicted by a grand jury on several charges related to alleged financial misconduct and other offenses. He was a managing partner at the law office of Duncan & Owens, located in Aberton. After these charges were brought, Michael Morgan sought to suppress certain evidence obtained by agents of federal authorities during two separate searches at the law office of Duncan & Owens.

 The first search took place in May 1992, pursuant to a warrant permitting agents of the IRS and the FBI to seize various financial records from January 1986 through May 1992. Although the warrant described a number of financial documents such as bank statements, canceled checks, and cash disbursement journals, it did not explicitly list “check stubs.” During the execution of that warrant, some materials dated prior to 1986 were taken, along with a sizable quantity of check stubs bundled with rubber bands. The agents initially observed only the top stubs and did not individually inspect the entire bundle on-site.

 In November 1992, federal authorities executed a second search warrant at the law office of Duncan & Owens, seeking additional financial materials based on a different set of charges against Michael Morgan. This time, the warrant explicitly referenced “check stubs” along with other types of records. Michael Morgan then moved to suppress all items seized in both searches, arguing that certain documents—particularly the check stubs and pre-1986 items—were taken improperly and that any evidence arising from or involving those materials should also be excluded.

 In support of admitting and using the evidence from both searches, the Government maintains that the May 1992 warrant was sufficiently broad in describing classes of financial documents so as to encompass check stubs. The Government’s position is that check stubs share characteristics with other named items, functioning similarly to a cash disbursement journal. They cite long-standing precedent allowing the seizure of items that fall within a warrant’s broader, functional descriptions rather than requiring exact, rigid nomenclature. They also argue that the items might be seized under the plain view doctrine, referencing decisions such as Horton v. California and Arizona v. Hicks, contending that experienced agents would immediately see the evidentiary value of such financial documents when searching for evidence of structured transactions and related offenses. The Government notes that neither inadvertence nor lack of precise labeling, on its own, can prohibit the seizure of evidence when probable cause remains intact.

 In urging the exclusion of the disputed materials, Michael Morgan contends that the May 1992 search warrant omitted mention of check stubs entirely, implying that seizing them went beyond the specific bounds of the warrant. That omission, he says, was significant because it allegedly shows that federal authorities either neglected to request, or were denied, permission to look for these exact items. According to Michael Morgan, the warrant’s list should be strictly construed to avoid a “general search” that gathers items not contemplated by the neutral issuing authority. He argues that what was discovered on the bundled check stubs could not have been immediately recognized as incriminating, thus defeating any reliance on the plain view doctrine. Finally, he contends that if some materials were taken outside the scope of the initial warrant, it tainted the subsequent search, and all evidence tied to those items should be barred.
