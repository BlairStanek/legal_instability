You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Redwood Corporation built and operated a facility that processed animal bones obtained from beef packing operations in the Somerville area. The processing system yielded a product called gelatin bone, which Redwood Corporation sold for use in the photographic industry. On its tax return, Redwood Corporation claimed a special investment tax credit, characterizing its facility and equipment as “energy property” under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disputed this claim, asserting that Redwood Corporation’s facility did not qualify for that particular credit.

 Redwood Corporation’s business model hinged on the widespread shift toward large “boxed beef” fabricators in the Somerville area, which produced a steady supply of animal bones. Redwood Corporation argued that these bones constituted solid waste that it was recycling into a valuable raw material for commercial use. The Commissioner pointed to regulations stating that equipment used to process “animal waste” does not qualify under the “recovery equipment” portion of the relevant Treasury guidelines, unless the equipment is used to transform such waste into fuel or energy.

 Both the legal framework and the practical application of Redwood Corporation’s facility were at issue. Redwood Corporation contended that its processes met the statutory definition of recycling equipment, emphasizing that “recycling” was not formally defined in the Code and should be construed broadly. The Commissioner took the position that recycling typically refers to a cyclical process in which the end product is the same or essentially similar to the original product, and argued that animal bones converted into a new type of raw material did not fit that concept. Additionally, Redwood Corporation challenged the validity of the regulation excluding animal waste from the scope of eligible recycling equipment, while the Commissioner maintained that the regulation was properly issued and reflected legislative intent.

 In support of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue prevailing, the arguments focused on the notion that Redwood Corporation’s activity was not the kind of cyclical recycling that Congress intended to support through the “energy property” tax credit. According to these arguments, the equipment used to extract gelatin bone from animal skeletal material could not fairly be categorized as the type of recovery activity envisioned by I.R.C. section 48(l)(6). The Commissioner pointed out that under long-standing Treasury regulatory authority, reinforced by specific legislative grants under I.R.C. section 38(b) and section 7805(a), it is permissible to clarify statutory terms in a manner consistent with congressional purpose. The Commissioner also referenced examples in legislative materials featuring paper, glass, and metals being converted into forms that closely track their original raw state, and contended that this illustrated a requirement that the end product be materially the same as the original product. In this view, Redwood Corporation’s extraction process—although commercially useful—did not constitute recycling as understood by either the legislative history or common statutory interpretation. Furthermore, the Commissioner maintained that the official regulation explicitly excluding animal waste was a reasonable exercise of rulemaking authority, consistent with the Code, and entitled to judicial deference.

 In support of Redwood Corporation prevailing, the arguments rested on contesting both the Commissioner’s narrow reading of the term “recycle” and the related Treasury regulation. Redwood Corporation stressed that Congress left “recycle” undefined, indicating an intent to allow a broad interpretation consistent with the ordinary understanding of transforming waste materials into items of economic value. By that reasoning, the characterization of animal bones as “solid waste” should mean that Redwood Corporation’s processes of extracting gelatin qualified under I.R.C. section 48(l)(6). Redwood Corporation further contended that the Treasury regulation’s exclusion of animal waste was invalid because it went beyond merely interpreting the statute and instead carved out an exception that the statute itself did not impose. Highlighting examples where courts have invalidated regulations that were inconsistent with the plain language or common-sense meaning of the Code, Redwood Corporation argued that its process was squarely within the spirit of encouraging resource recovery or recycling. Thus, Redwood Corporation maintained that neither legislative history nor the language of the Code supported restricting “recycling” to outcomes that produce the identical product from which the waste originated, and that the regulation was thus improperly narrowing a statutory provision that should be applied more expansively.
