You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Riley is president and co-owner of Haven Delivery Service, a corporation that delivers beverages to various commercial establishments in a county located in Washington. Jordan Riley has been a member of Local 109 of the Transporters Union, and Haven Delivery Service and Local 109 entered into a collective bargaining agreement. That agreement included certain provisions covering health benefits, identifying which workers were deemed part of the bargaining unit. Jordan Riley, even as president and owner, performed at least some of the work that would typically be performed by bargaining unit members.

 For many years, Haven Delivery Service had paid contributions to the Horizon Workers Health Fund on Jordan Riley’s behalf. Jordan Riley had also maintained a separate health insurance policy through Haven Health Plan. After an audit by Pacific Administrators, Inc., which served as administrator for the Horizon Workers Health Fund, questions arose regarding whether Jordan Riley was eligible for Fund benefits under the collective bargaining agreement. The administrator noted that Jordan Riley spent much of his work time engaged in managerial or supervisory tasks. However, because Jordan Riley had previously received Fund benefits, he believed that his ongoing contributions should continue to entitle him to coverage.

 When Jordan Riley’s eligibility was questioned, he pursued an appeal before the Fund’s appeals committee. The committee considered documentation and testimony indicating that he did some bargaining unit work, but also that he performed a majority of non-bargaining unit tasks. The committee ultimately concluded that he had not completed enough hours of bargaining unit work and therefore deemed him ineligible under applicable Fund rules. Jordan Riley challenged that decision, arguing that the collective bargaining agreement’s requirement of compensating a member for a minimum number of hours should not be interpreted as specifically requiring bargaining unit hours.

 In support of Horizon Workers Health Fund, it was argued that the ordinary meaning of the collective bargaining agreement implied that only hours spent on bargaining unit tasks fulfill the minimum threshold for eligibility. They pointed to provisions referencing “bargaining unit work” and emphasized the need to interpret such language consistently with the Fund’s rules, guided by a fiduciary obligation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Fund’s approach, according to these arguments, was that the agreement’s structure and wording—as well as standard practices—required limiting health benefits to those who performed sufficient unit work. They also relied on established precedent, including cases such as Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, which addresses deference to plan administrators’ interpretations, and asserted that the Fund’s discretion to interpret ambiguous contract provisions should be respected so long as their interpretation was reasonable. The Fund argued that it was neither arbitrary nor capricious to require that an employee’s threshold hours had to be hours of bargaining unit work, considering the agreement’s focus on protecting workers who substantially perform union duties.

 In support of Jordan Riley, it was contended that the collective bargaining agreement plainly states that any member of the bargaining unit who is compensated for a certain minimum of hours in a given month is eligible for the Fund’s benefits. According to this reading, the text does not distinguish between hours of bargaining unit work and any other type of compensation. Jordan Riley’s side noted that adding an extra requirement (specifically, 80 hours of bargaining unit work) effectively rewrites the agreement in a manner not found in its written provisions. These arguments cited precedent such as Blau v. Del Monte Corp. for the proposition that an administrator’s insertion of a new requirement is an impermissible alteration of plan terms. Jordan Riley’s position was that, since he indisputably performed some bargaining unit tasks and was paid in excess of the threshold hours, he should qualify for coverage under the express language of the agreement, without any additional unstated requirement.
