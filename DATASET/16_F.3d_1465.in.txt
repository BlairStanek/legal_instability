You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In a certain year, the Jacobs owned multiple commercial buildings in Lakeville. They hired Morgan, doing business as Evergreen Management, to manage these buildings. Among the properties under Morgan’s management were addresses on Lake Street and Main Avenue in Lakeville. The Jacobs and Morgan had a written agreement that empowered Morgan to procure liability insurance for the Jacobs, with the costs to be borne by the Jacobs.

 Greenwood Insurance issued a liability policy on the Jacobs’ buildings, including the one located at Main Avenue in Lakeville. After a sizable premium was quoted, Morgan arranged financing on behalf of the Jacobs through Regal Premium Funding, which paid the insurer the full premium. The policy documents contained language providing Greenwood Insurance the ability to cancel coverage upon a proper request submitted under a power of attorney contained in the financing agreement. At a later point, Regal Premium Funding submitted a cancellation request to Greenwood Insurance, which the insurer followed. Shortly afterward, an individual named Jeremy Dawson allegedly died in a fall from a second-floor railing at the Main Avenue property. The Dawson Estate then brought legal action against the Jacobs for wrongful death. Greenwood Insurance initially denied coverage based on the purported cancellation but later indicated it might provide a defense subject to certain conditions.

 Disagreements arose regarding whether Regal Premium Funding provided the Jacobs with adequate notice before requesting that Greenwood Insurance cancel the policy, whether the Jacobs had received any timely warnings of the impending cancellation, and whether Morgan exceeded the authority granted in the management agreement by entering into a financing arrangement. The dispute also involved whether Greenwood Insurance, through its subsequent communications, relinquished any right to rely on cancellation as a defense. The conflict ultimately led to litigation that required a judicial decision about whether the policy was still in force at the time of the alleged accident and who, if anyone, bore responsibility for ensuring notice was properly given to the Jacobs.

 Greenwood Insurance’s principal legal arguments rested on the language of the insurance policy and the premium financing documents that gave Regal Premium Funding the contractual right to cancel coverage as the Jacobs’ attorney-in-fact. Greenwood Insurance contended that it was permitted to rely on the representations of Regal Premium Funding regarding compliance with applicable legal requirements. It pointed to the Illinois Premium Finance Act, arguing that any duties to provide notice under this statute applied only to the financing company, not to the insurer. Greenwood Insurance cited the principle that, under recognized doctrine, an insurer need not independently investigate a financing company’s compliance with statutory notice provisions unless the applicable laws explicitly place such a burden on the insurer. Further, Greenwood Insurance maintained that Morgan, in managing the Jacobs’ properties, had implied authority to arrange premium financing as part of procuring insurance. Lastly, Greenwood Insurance argued that even if it had offered a partial defense under a reservation of rights, it did not waive previously stated grounds for non-coverage because its reservation of rights letter clearly reserved all possible defenses.

 The Jacobs’ principal legal arguments centered on the Illinois Premium Finance Act’s requirement that an insured be provided with a clear notice of intent to cancel and a chance to cure any payment defaults, a safeguard found in the text of the statute. The Jacobs asserted that Regal Premium Funding did not follow the law’s ten-day warning requirement. As a result, the Jacobs claimed that the purported cancellation had no legal effect and the policy remained intact. The Jacobs also contended that the insurer was responsible, under bedrock principles of insurance law, for ensuring effectively that cancellations occur only with adequate notice to an insured, and that Greenwood Insurance could not dispense with this responsibility by relying solely on the financing company. Additionally, the Jacobs claimed that Morgan lacked authority to enter into such a large premium financing contract, or at least that it was questionable enough to preclude the financing company from exerting a valid power of attorney. Finally, the Jacobs argued that by previously offering a defense (even with reservations) on different grounds, Greenwood Insurance impliedly waived or relinquished the defense of policy cancellation and could not reassert it later.
