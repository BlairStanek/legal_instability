You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Carter served in the U.S. Air Force during the late 1960s and was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the early 1990s. He filed a claim with the local office in Town A, North Carolina, asserting that he had achieved a valid diagnosis within seven years of leaving the service. Carter’s contention relied on his statements that he experienced an early symptom of multiple sclerosis—optic neuritis—during the requisite period.

 Initially, Carter indicated that Dr. Jordan Lee treated him for optic neuritis in or around the mid-1970s. When asked for supporting files, Dr. Lee responded that no original records remained but submitted a letter recalling a 1976 diagnosis, based solely on memory. In support of Carter’s claim, three individuals from Community C Religious Center submitted letters stating that Carter had experienced problems with his vision around that same general time, although the correspondents could not provide a precise date or fully document the circumstance.

 The local office in Town A looked for contemporaneous medical records and found none that established a confirmed diagnosis of optic neuritis or related symptoms during the seven-year post-service window. The lack of any direct documentation led the local office, and later the board, to consider whether recollections from Dr. Lee and the three letters from Community C Religious Center collectively raised sufficient evidence under the benefit-of-the-doubt standard and presumption rules. Throughout these proceedings, Carter asserted that the local office and the board should have accepted Dr. Lee’s memory-based letter and the supporting lay statements as conclusive or at least evenly balanced in his favor.

 In support of Morgan’s position, it was argued that the benefit-of-the-doubt principle and the statutory presumption for multiple sclerosis still require some reliable piece of evidence placing the onset of characteristic symptoms within seven years of discharge. Morgan stressed that Dr. Lee’s letter was based on recollection alone and was contradicted by certain treatment records and timeline details that raised questions about exactly when Carter’s eye condition arose. Morgan also underscored that the lay statements never confirmed a specific date for Carter’s reported vision issues, thus failing to pinpoint them within the necessary period. Citing 38 U.S.C. § 1112 and related provisions, Morgan asserted that Congress allowed a presumption only when consistent evidence established that symptoms manifested to a compensable degree within seven years, and that the board was obliged to weigh whether the available evidence merely raised a remote possibility rather than a substantial and balanced doubt.

 In support of Carter’s position, it was contended that the evidence from Dr. Lee should be deemed sufficient because a single credible medical statement can establish a diagnosis date, especially under the statutory grace period for multiple sclerosis. Carter maintained that 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 obligate decisionmakers to resolve any close call in the claimant’s favor. Carter also argued that the three letters from individuals in Community C Religious Center supported the proposition that he experienced symptoms consistent with optic neuritis within the pivotal window. Emphasizing the nonadversarial nature of veterans claims and citing the importance of liberal interpretation of evidence in such proceedings, Carter asserted that the relevant statutes do not require strict documentary proof in order to grant the benefit-of-the-doubt presumption.
