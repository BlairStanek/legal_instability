You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Prairie Supplies, Inc. had engaged in numerous precious-metals transactions with River Town Bank before that institution closed. After the closing, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for River Town Bank. Prairie Supplies, Inc. later brought a suit in a state court against the FDIC, in its role as receiver, seeking relief connected to handling of certain deposits and assets that Prairie Supplies, Inc. claimed were owed. The suit eventually proceeded to trial, where a jury resolved various factual issues.

 Once the jury had returned a verdict, Prairie Supplies, Inc. sought permission from the state court to amend its filing to add the FDIC—separately referred to as operating in its corporate capacity—as an additional party. The FDIC did not initiate this attempt to include it in that further capacity; rather, Prairie Supplies, Inc. moved to bring in the FDIC’s corporate role after the verdict. Judgment was entered in the state court’s records reflecting liability against both the FDIC (as receiver) and the FDIC (in its corporate capacity).

 Following that development, the FDIC, in its corporate capacity, filed a notice to remove the entire matter to the district court, raising questions about whether, and when, “the Corporation” had become a party for purposes of removal timelines. Disagreement arose as to whether the FDIC, in separate roles, possessed independent rights to remove the action and whether the statutory period had run once the suit naming the FDIC (as receiver) had commenced or only later when the FDIC (in its corporate capacity) was formally added.

 One set of arguments contended that the FDIC’s statutory removal authority should be understood as broad and flexible, in keeping with legislative goals to furnish the FDIC with a reliable federal forum for claims involving federally insured deposits. These arguments pointed to the language of 12 U.S.C. § 1819, emphasizing that FDIC responsibilities in different capacities safeguard distinct interests—one set confined to the estate of the closed institution, and another pertaining to deposit insurance funds. Citing decisions that interpret FIRREA’s provisions to expand federal jurisdiction when the FDIC is involved, this position underscored that the FDIC bears obligations in fundamentally separate roles, so each role’s timeline for removal must be treated independently. This reasoning drew on interpretations of 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(B) that highlight a 90-day period running from the point each FDIC capacity faces direct exposure in a lawsuit.

 Another set of arguments maintained that the FDIC, regardless of the capacity in which it appears, is a single entity for removal purposes, and that once “the Corporation” is sued, the period to remove must be strictly limited. This viewpoint noted that 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(B) confers only one opportunity for the FDIC to remove a case. It further stressed that the statutory text’s references to “the Corporation” do not specify multiple capacities and that adding the phrase “in any capacity” in one subsection but not in another suggests Congress intended a single starting point for the FDIC to exercise removal. Citing continuity in how the FDIC responds to litigation to avoid midstream switching of courts, this perspective emphasized a strict reading of the statutory language that once the FDIC, in any form, is named, the removal clock should not restart by a subsequent designation of a different FDIC role.
