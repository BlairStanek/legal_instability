You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Rose was charged in California with two counts of murder, each carrying a special circumstance of multiple murders, as well as kidnapping and assault with intent to commit rape. Upon his first appearance in the municipal court, a public defender was appointed to represent him. After a short passage of time, the court scheduled a hearing. Rose asserts that, for nearly two months, he received no communication from the public defender, during which period he was transferred to the “pro per” section of the jail. On a later date, he appeared in the municipal court by himself to present several pro se motions.

 In open court, Rose complained that his appointed counsel had not responded to his letters or calls and had undertaken no investigation. Seeing no meaningful defense being prepared, Rose announced his intent to proceed without that lawyer. The municipal court briefly addressed Rose’s concerns but did not formally evaluate whether two months of inactivity was acceptable in a capital proceeding. Rose maintained that he merely desired competent representation and concluded, under the circumstances, that his only option was to represent himself.

 Shortly afterward, at a subsequent session in the municipal court, the public defender was again present alongside Rose, but they did not explore in detail what had (or had not) been done on Rose’s behalf. Rose contended that he was effectively forced into waiving counsel to ensure his defense did not stall further. The State answered that the public defender had, in fact, met with Rose earlier, discussing potential strategies and defenses, and that any delay was neither unexplained nor improper, especially before a preliminary hearing. The State also argued that Rose took issue only with a tactical disagreement and a denial of his preference for a different attorney, rather than any genuine lack of ability by the appointed counsel.

 On Rose’s side, key points cite various decisions emphasizing that defendants are constitutionally entitled to the effective assistance of counsel, and that having to choose between self-representation and an allegedly dormant or inert attorney is no real choice at all. Rose leans on principles from authorities like United States v. Robinson and Lofton v. Procurer, contending that no one should be forced to accept incompetent representation. He highlights that a gap in communication lasting two months near the outset of a capital case risks witness memory loss and other evidentiary issues. Rose insists that ensuring an attorney’s active engagement from the start is vital given the gravity of the potential sentence, and that the municipal court should have determined whether the ongoing lack of communication fell below constitutionally required levels before allowing him to represent himself.

 The State’s arguments center on established holdings, such as Adams v. Carroll and United States v. Padilla, which clarify that a defendant has no absolute right to choose a particular lawyer. The State maintains that disagreements over strategy, dissatisfaction with the pace of preparation, or distaste for the individual attorney do not alone establish incompetence. Based on initial meetings and planning, the State asserts that the public defender was competent and ready for the preliminary hearing, so any inactivity was more apparent than real. In the State’s view, the record lacked any showing of deficient performance rising to constitutional significance, thus eliminating any obligation on the municipal court to probe the public defender’s capabilities before acknowledging Rose’s decision to go without counsel.
