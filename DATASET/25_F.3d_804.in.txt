You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, the Quinn Society, a group of individuals opposed to certain medical procedures, organized large demonstrations at privately owned facilities called West Health Complex. Members of the Quinn Society had conducted similar activities elsewhere, prompting the City of San Diego to anticipate attempts to block entrances and physically prevent access to these private properties. In the period just before the events at issue, senior officials in the City of San Diego decided to adopt specific procedures for dispersing and arresting individuals who would not leave when ordered to do so.

 The demonstrations drew more than a hundred participants who sat in corridors, on stairwells, and at entrances, impeding staff, patients, and others from entering West Health Complex. When confronted by officers, the Quinn Society demonstrators adopted a tactic of passive resistance, remaining seated and refusing to walk or bear their own weight during arrest. A specialized team of police received instructions to employ certain methods, referred to as “pain compliance,” instead of “drag-and-carry” removal. This policy came from the concern that forcibly lifting multiple disobedient individuals might injure arresting officers and demonstrators, and that passivity on a large scale could create logistical problems if swift removals did not occur.

 During several arrests, officers placed a device known as OPNs around the wrists of demonstrators and progressively applied pressure until the demonstrators attempted to stand or walk. In some instances, officers had to switch to manual holds, such as pulling individuals by their clothing or using pressure points, when demonstrators could not or would not stand on their own. People including Terry Ellis, Morgan Ross, and Casey White later described injuries such as bruising or ligament strain. Some believed these methods were unnecessarily painful. The City of San Diego, for its part, stated that it relied on the directives of its officials, such as Officer Jordan and Officer Marsh, in situations deemed to present possible safety and crowd-control concerns. Police personnel, including Captain Lane, described the crowded conditions, the risk of confrontation with bystanders, and the department’s desire to minimize overall harm as justification for this approach to arrest.

 The City of San Diego contends that its chosen arrest techniques comport with constitutional standards as set forth in such authorities as Graham v. Connor, emphasizing that law enforcement decisions must be evaluated under an objective reasonableness standard. The City of San Diego asserts that it properly balanced the individual’s right to personal security with the City’s legitimate interest in maintaining public order. It points to the potential risk of back injuries for officers and demonstrators if a drag-and-carry approach were used repetitively, and it notes that officers tried warnings and verbal persuasion before applying progressively increasing force. The City of San Diego also highlights that relevant precedents, including references to Barlow v. Ground and Hammer v. Gross, do not require the least painful method but only a method fairly appropriate under the circumstances. Maintaining that large-scale passive resistance presented a pressing public safety concern—as described hypothetically in scenarios involving organized demonstrations—the City of San Diego argues that its policy’s emphasis on safely removing multiple demonstrators was in line with recognized government interests in preventing the blockage of private property. Citing references analogous to City of Los Angeles v. Heller, the City of San Diego asserts that the evolving situation, with possible counter-protests and heightened tensions, demanded a measure of police control to prevent broader unrest or injury.

 The Quinn Society counters that the use of devices such as OPNs was disproportionate to the misdemeanor nature of the offenses, especially since their members were unarmed, did not fight back, and merely refused to move. The Quinn Society relies on standards from Graham v. Connor to argue that the second factor—immediacy of a threat—was not present because none of its members lashed out or demonstrated violent behavior. The Quinn Society also points to Tennessee v. Garner for the proposition that police force requires close scrutiny when it inflicts bodily harm, especially against suspects who are not actively resisting in a threatening way. The Quinn Society emphasizes that the City deliberately adopted the pain-compliance policy in advance, without allowing officers on scene to decide if a less forceful measure might serve just as well. The Quinn Society cites its experiences, including those of individuals like Terry Ellis and Morgan Ross, who testified that the pain techniques caused severe distress yet did not reliably make them walk on their own. They argue that this rendered the methods simply punitive and thus unreasonable under Fourth Amendment principles. Their position is that more conventional approaches—for example, either limited carrying or other targeted control holds—would have been more consistent with longstanding constitutional limits on law enforcement in peaceful protest scenarios.
