You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Star Payment Solutions is a company headquartered in Meadowpeak, Kansas, with a registered set of marks that incorporate the term “UNIVERSAL.” Since 1981, it has issued electronic banking cards through contracts with financial institutions, and these cards allow purchases, insurance product access, and the ability to obtain cash from various automatic teller machines (ATMs). The ATMs bearing Star Payment Solutions’ marks will also accept cards from other networks with which Star Payment Solutions has affiliations. Star Payment Solutions uses its marks on cards, on printed materials when mailing cards, on ATM receipts, on prominent signs, and on the external surfaces of ATMs.

 Acme Telco is a company with millions of cardholders across the United States. It introduced a combination calling and retail credit card bearing the name “Acme Telco Universal Card.” This card can be used for telephone calls, for retail credit purchases at merchants associated with Monza and Octacard, and for obtaining cash from ATMs featuring the Addit or Monza logos. Because Acme Telco and Star Payment Solutions have no affiliation, the card from Acme Telco is not accepted at Star Payment Solutions’ ATMs. Star Payment Solutions learned of the Acme Telco card shortly after its introduction when key personnel viewed a national television advertisement.

 Star Payment Solutions brought a legal action, alleging that Acme Telco’s use of “Universal” on its credit card infringed upon Star Payment Solutions’ registered marks. There were preliminary requests for an injunction. Both sides gathered information on whether consumers confused Acme Telco’s card with Star Payment Solutions’ cards or services. Discovery revealed that hundreds of Acme Telco cardholders attempted to use their card in Star Payment Solutions’ ATMs, though it was not accepted. Acme Telco surveyed some of these cardholders, finding that only a small portion connected the word “Universal” on the ATM with the same word on the Acme Telco card. Star Payment Solutions also gathered statements suggesting that a notable subset of cardholders believed the “Universal” wording indicated a shared source or that both products worked interchangeably. The two businesses disagreed over how these attempts and consumer perceptions reflected on any alleged confusion in the marketplace. Star Payment Solutions later sought further discovery to survey a wider group of Acme Telco cardholders in different local areas but reported difficulty obtaining identifying information about them.

 Arguments supporting Acme Telco center on an assertion that “Universal” is a widely used, relatively weak term, meaning consumers would be less likely to assume all products containing that word come from the same source. Under trademark infringement principles in 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a) and related authority, Acme Telco’s position emphasizes that the overall appearance of its card—with the Acme Telco house name and distinctive logos—differs substantially from Star Payment Solutions’ cards. Citing sources interpreting likelihood of confusion, this position asserts that the stark difference in appearance, sound, and branding of the products would lead reasonable consumers to regard Acme Telco’s card as distinct, decreasing any risk of attributing it to Star Payment Solutions. Acme Telco highlights that the card has been strongly promoted under Acme Telco’s own name, with expensive campaigns that build on Acme Telco’s established identity—evidence, it is argued, that consumers identify the source as Acme Telco. Any consumers who attempted to use the card at Star Payment Solutions’ ATMs, according to Acme Telco, did so not because of confusion over the word “Universal” but simply due to the common assumption that a credit or debit card is valid at most ATMs, regardless of the name or brand displayed.

 Arguments supporting Star Payment Solutions rely on trademark infringement standards that focus on the actual presence of confusion or a likelihood of confusion among reasonable consumers. Star Payment Solutions refers to legal precedent that a growing number of individuals have tried to use Acme Telco’s card in Star Payment Solutions’ ATMs, citing this as a real-world example of confusion stemming from Acme Telco’s selection of “Universal.” In addition, Star Payment Solutions underlines statements from supporters showing that some cardholders believed the two companies’ services were related due to the repeated use of “Universal” on both the card and ATMs. Star Payment Solutions characterizes both businesses’ services—access to credit, ATM withdrawals, and other financial features—as sufficiently similar to amplify confusion, urging that under the Lanham Act, a term that overlaps in the financial services sphere can mislead users. By reference to key judicial tests, Star Payment Solutions contends that the risk of confusion is not simply theoretical but supported by the consistent pattern of erroneous usage, phone surveys revealing a significant segment of respondents who connected the two services, and inquiries from financial partners uncertain about any affiliation. This side further asserts that it lacked the full ability to develop supplementary evidence from local Acme Telco cardholders due to incomplete discovery responses, so the extent of confusion, it contends, may be even broader than already documented.
