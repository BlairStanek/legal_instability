You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Twelve female high school students, referred to as Taylor, play slow-pitch softball in Kentucky and allege unfair treatment in school athletics. They claim that the Kentucky State Board for Elementary and Secondary Education oversees athletics at public schools through a delegated arrangement, and that the Elmwood League, a non-governmental association of member high schools, manages interscholastic sports under the Board’s authority. Taylor asserts that the Board and the Elmwood League jointly control whether new sports are officially recognized and which championship tournaments are conducted.

 Taylor contends that girls’ sports are not offered on equal terms with boys’ sports. In particular, they highlight the Elmwood League’s refusal to sanction fast-pitch softball for girls. The Elmwood League has a policy that requires at least twenty-five percent of its member schools to indicate they will participate before a sport can be sanctioned. Taylor claims this rule severely restricts their options, especially because fast-pitch softball is a popular college-level game with scholarship opportunities, while slow-pitch softball does not enjoy the same collegiate recognition.

 Taylor further argues that the Board and the Elmwood League should be subject to federal nondiscrimination mandates, including Title IX, because the Board receives its funding through the Kentucky Department of Education, a recipient of federal aid, and the Elmwood League receives membership dues from schools that themselves receive federal funds. Taylor believes that the structural ties between the Board, the Department of Education, and the Elmwood League bring the entire athletic program within the reach of federal laws prohibiting sex-based discrimination.

 Taylor maintains that federal statutes, including Title IX of the Education Amendments and its related regulations, obligate the Board and the Elmwood League to ensure that girls have genuinely equal athletic opportunities. They point to cases interpreting Title IX broadly so that if any part of an educational system receives federal aid, all of its activities must comply with that law’s antidiscrimination requirements. Taylor emphasizes that slow-pitch softball and fast-pitch softball differ in important skills and potential scholarship pathways; they argue that being forced to rely solely on a slow-pitch option undermines female athletes’ collegiate prospects. They claim that the twenty-five percent rule has a disproportionate, negative effect on women’s participation opportunities, advancing the principle from various court decisions that a rule adopted in a context of longstanding limitations on women’s sports must be carefully scrutinized to ensure it really does accommodate female students’ interests.

 By contrast, the Kentucky State Board for Elementary and Secondary Education and the Elmwood League contend that their procedures do not discriminate on the basis of gender, because they neither bar girls from joining existing teams nor prohibit member schools from fielding their own fast-pitch squads. They cite doctrines established by Washington v. Davis and Personnel Adm’r v. Feeney, among others, to argue that policies are lawful if they do not purposefully discriminate even if they result in some uneven impact. They assert that no girls are categorically excluded, and that the Board’s delegation to the Elmwood League is carried out through neutral standards, including the twenty-five percent threshold, which they say applies generally across different proposed sports. They also maintain that Title IX does not apply to them because they do not directly receive federal financial assistance, emphasizing that the Elmwood League’s revenue source is largely gate receipts and membership dues, rather than earmarked public funds, and that this arrangement immunizes them from Title IX obligations.
