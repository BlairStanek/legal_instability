You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Anthony Fields worked as a professional accountant for a private accounting firm before being brought in-house at Maritime Dock, Inc. He served in several capacities at Maritime Dock, including controller, treasurer, and assistant secretary. He also held a seat on Maritime Dock’s Board of Directors and possessed some shares in the company. During his time there, the chief executive and controlling shareholder was another individual who oversaw general management decisions and had the final say on many financial matters.

 While Anthony Fields managed an internal accounting department at Maritime Dock, Inc., the company began to struggle with cash-flow issues. Part of Mr. Fields’s duties involved signing checks and overseeing the payment of creditors. He prepared certain corporate and tax-related documents, though he has denied having the independent authority to select which creditors received payment. At some point, Maritime Dock, Inc. fell behind on its federal employment tax obligations, and Mr. Fields was aware of the overdue amounts to the Internal Revenue Service.

 There is a competing view that Mr. Fields’s check-writing role was purely ministerial. He contends that he wrote checks only at the direction of the company’s chief executive and that funds were rarely in the corporate accounts unless specifically deposited by that superior. Mr. Fields asserts that he risked losing his job if he had attempted to pay the outstanding taxes without express approval. Furthermore, he contends that his technical titles and signatory status never translated into final decision-making power over which bills were to be paid.

 Supporters of the position favoring The United States emphasize precedents interpreting 26 U.S.C. § 6672, which establish liability for a “responsible person” who “willfully” fails to pay withheld tax. They point to factors often considered in determining who is responsible: the authority to sign checks, the person’s corporate office, the ability to direct payments, and the oversight of corporate finances. From this perspective, once an individual has actual knowledge of unpaid employment taxes, making payments to other creditors or continuing the company’s operations rather than ensuring tax remittance can show willfulness. They further rely on decisions suggesting that fear of job loss or a superior’s instructions not to pay do not absolve someone with check-signing powers or banking access from responsibility. The argument concludes that holding an official position with the ability to sign checks—and knowing of the tax delinquency—constitutes, at minimum, a conscious choice to pay other debts ahead of the government, which the statutes and case law treat as willful nonpayment.

 Advocates for Anthony Fields argue that he lacked genuine control over Maritime Dock’s finances because the chief executive maintained absolute authority and exerted strict oversight over every payment. They cite examples in which an individual may have official titles but effectively acts at the behest of a dominant superior. They rely on the principle that mere check-writing capability—unaccompanied by real power to decide which bills or creditors get priority—should not rise to the level of “significant control” required by law. They also stress that knowledge of unpaid obligations alone does not necessarily trigger liability unless the individual has the real-world ability to allocate funds. Therefore, they contend that if Mr. Fields was only performing a perfunctory function without discretion, was threatened with dismissal if he acted independently, and in fact could not force the company’s funds to be used for taxes, then he should not be deemed a responsible person who willfully failed to pay under the statute.
