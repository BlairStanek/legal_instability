You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Taylor Johnson was called before a grand jury in connection with an investigation into alleged tax liabilities for several consecutive years. The grand jury issued a subpoena directing Taylor Johnson to sign a form that would authorize various financial institutions to disclose documents and information related to any accounts in which Taylor Johnson held an interest. When asked to comply, Taylor Johnson declined to sign the authorization, citing concerns about constitutional rights and about the legality of the directive under Austrian law.

 The Government asked the district court to order Taylor Johnson to sign the authorization. In support of its request, the Government claimed that the authorization referred only generally to potential accounts and did not itself identify any specific institution, acknowledge any actual accounts, or authenticate any documents. The district court granted the motion to compel and set a deadline for Taylor Johnson to sign. Taylor Johnson again refused, arguing that compelled signing would violate both federal constitutional protections and provisions of Austrian law.

 In response, the Government pursued a contempt ruling, resulting in a fine and confinement order against Taylor Johnson, pending compliance or the expiration of the grand jury’s term. Taylor Johnson opposed the contempt finding and maintained that Austrian law, including a general directive of banking secrecy and safeguards in the European Convention on Human Rights, prevented forced consent. Two expert declarations, one by Alex Martin and one by Jordan Taylor, were put forth to explain how Austrian statutes prohibited coerced consent, especially in matters where there was a possibility of criminal sanctions. The Government, however, noted that Taylor Johnson, as a resident of the United States, was obligated under U.S. laws to disclose foreign financial relationships.

 In support of the Government’s position that Taylor Johnson should be compelled to sign, the arguments relied on precedent indicating that signing a generic authorization directive does not constitute a testimonial act for purposes of constitutional self-incrimination protections. Citing cases like Doe v. United States and Fisher v. United States, the Government’s argument highlighted that an authorization, by itself, does not reveal specific information or confirm the existence or authenticity of documents. The Government also invoked decisions suggesting that individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in bank records maintained by financial institutions, under statutes such as the Bank Secrecy Act, and in light of regulations that require reporting of foreign accounts. These arguments emphasized that regulatory regimes permit collecting financial information for lawful investigative purposes. The Government also pointed to international comity considerations, contending that the need to investigate and prosecute alleged tax violations that occurred during Taylor Johnson’s residence in the United States outweighed any interest that might be implicated in Austrian banking confidentiality rules.

 In support of Taylor Johnson’s position, the arguments focused on the theory that compelling the signing of a document that would release potentially incriminating details violates both constitutional protections and foreign legal principles. Under Hoffman v. United States and related jurisprudence, Taylor Johnson’s party maintained that compelled authorization could serve as a final link in proving a suspected offense, thus implicating self-incrimination concerns. Further, the experts on Austrian law asserted that forced consent to disclose banking information would run afoul of local statutes that penalize compelled confessions or compelled releases of information. They pointed to prohibitions on unauthorized investigation activities within Austrian territory and contended that international comity demands deferring to Austrian laws protecting its citizens and residents from extraterritorial compulsion in ways that bypass Austrian judicial processes. Under these views, the Government’s interest in the records did not justify flouting Austrian norms, derived in part from the European Convention on Human Rights and the local banking secrecy statute, which they argued was designed to safeguard the private relationship between account-holders and their financial institutions.
