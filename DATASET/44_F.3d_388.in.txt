You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Redwood National Banks operate in several Kentucky communities with fewer than 5,000 residents. They sought licenses from the Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance to sell a variety of insurance products. The Commissioner declined to grant these requests, stating that a Kentucky statute barred bank holding companies, and by extension certain banks, from engaging in the full range of insurance agency activity. Redwood National Banks then initiated a legal action in federal court, seeking a declaration that federal law allows them to act as insurance agents in small Kentucky towns.

 After Redwood National Banks filed their complaint, an administrative hearing had been scheduled to resolve whether the Kentucky statute prohibited them from acting as insurance agents. The bank group requested and received a stay of those administrative proceedings, preferring instead to pursue their federal lawsuit. The Clearview Insurance Alliance, composed of multiple insurance industry members, intervened alongside the Commissioner to support the statute’s enforcement. The United States intervened in support of Redwood National Banks, aligning with the banks’ assertion that federal law preempts the state’s prohibition on insurance sales by certain banks.

 Redwood National Banks argued that the federal statute, 12 U.S.C. § 92, confers upon them a right to solicit and sell insurance in communities meeting population criteria, whereas the Commissioner and the Clearview Insurance Alliance maintained that Kentucky’s statute lawfully restricts that activity. The Commissioner and the Clearview Insurance Alliance also invoked the McCarran-Ferguson Act, arguing that it protects state insurance regulations from potential federal preemption. In addition, they claimed that another federal provision, section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act, preserved state regulatory authority. Both sides presented evidence about the scope of 12 U.S.C. § 92, the intended purpose of Kentucky’s insurance regulations, and the interplay between federal banking powers and state authority to oversee insurance practices.

 In support of Redwood National Banks’ position, references were made to a line of federal cases emphasizing that when federal law authorizes a certain activity, a conflicting state prohibition cannot stand. These arguments invoked decisions interpreting financial institution powers broadly, such as Franklin National Bank v. New York, which recognized that even permissive federal authorizations may override contrary state laws. Redwood National Banks also pointed to 12 U.S.C. § 92’s language asserting “may ... act as the agent” for insurance sales, contending that this phrase grants them a firm power to sell insurance in small towns. They contended that legislative history shows that Congress intended § 92 to serve as an additional revenue source for banks in rural areas, thereby promoting banking stability and assuring greater financial services for local residents. They asserted that Kentucky’s restriction undermines this objective. They further argued that the type of preemption here is not undermined by the McCarran-Ferguson Act because, in their view, the state measure does not regulate the business of insurance so much as it prohibits certain financial institutions from entering the field. Finally, Redwood National Banks argued that the language in section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act is irrelevant to any conflict between § 92 and a state statute, because that section simply addresses a different chapter of federal law.

 In contrast, the Commissioner and the Clearview Insurance Alliance vigorously contended that no direct conflict arises between the Kentucky statute and 12 U.S.C. § 92, asserting that just because the federal statute says the banks “may” undertake insurance sales does not mean it compels the activity where valid state laws regulate it. They relied on principles that states maintain considerable authority to regulate insurance under their traditional police powers. Their position emphasized that the McCarran-Ferguson Act serves to protect state legislation “enacted to regulate the business of insurance,” so that even if there were any tension between § 92 and the Kentucky statute, the latter should remain in force. According to them, the purpose of the statute at issue is to protect policyholders from potential coercion or conflicts of interest that might arise if banks dominate the insurance market in small communities. They also maintained that section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act recognizes the states’ role in regulating banks and their holding companies, thereby retaining for states the power to bar banks from certain lines of business, including the general sale of insurance.
