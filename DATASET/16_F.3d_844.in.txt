You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Nick Kelly and Arthur Lee are two Black men who served as deputy registrars in Carter County, Arkansas. During one election cycle, Nick Kelly was running for mayor in the town of Riverburg, Arkansas, and both men participated actively in voter registration and absentee ballot efforts. The Government brought charges against them, alleging that they conspired to submit multiple absentee ballots under other people’s names and thereby voted more than once in violation of federal law.

 In challenging these charges, Nick Kelly and Arthur Lee claimed that they were specifically targeted for prosecution because of their race. They submitted affidavits describing a variety of other irregularities that they believed were at least as serious as the accusations against them, including alleged voter intimidation methods employed by certain white political rivals in Carter County. They also provided statements detailing similar incidents of alleged voter discrimination and irregularities in Oak County, Pine County, and Maple County, all of which they said were ignored by federal and local authorities.

 Besides alleging selective prosecution, Nick Kelly and Arthur Lee argued that some of the Government’s peremptory challenges had improperly struck Black prospective jurors. They also questioned whether conduct for which they had been acquitted should factor into their sentences. Furthermore, they requested consideration of a downward departure from standard sentencing guidelines, citing the unique context of the election environment and their personal circumstances. The Government disputed both the request for discovery on selective prosecution and any suggestion that race drove its prosecution decisions.

 The Government contends that forging absentee ballots and consciously voting more than once are actions squarely prohibited by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, specifically pointing to 42 U.S.C. § 1973i(c) and (e) and 18 U.S.C. § 371. According to the Government, it acted within its broad prosecutorial discretion by focusing on these grave violations, which undermine the integrity of federal elections. It adds that the law enforcement apparatus is not obligated to prosecute every possible wrongdoing and that, under United States v. Matter and related precedents, defendants must meet a high threshold to prove selective prosecution. Thus, the Government insists that showing other kinds of voter-related misconduct by different individuals, especially if the misconduct differs in nature (such as intimidation versus forgery), does not amount to proving that the two men were singled out for racial reasons. The Government also maintains that peremptory strikes, scrutinized through Batson v. Kentucky, were exercised lawfully and that the men’s sentencing challenges do not override the ordinary application of federal sentencing statutes and guidelines, including U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0.

 Nick Kelly and Arthur Lee argue that the Government’s failure to investigate or prosecute others involved in allegedly comparable voter fraud in Carter County and nearby counties reflects that they were unfairly targeted. They rely on principles articulated in United States v. Gordon and similar cases, asserting that their race, combined with the similarity of voting irregularities committed by white adversaries, raises a strong inference of selective enforcement. They further contend that the Government’s peremptory challenges to Black jurors should be given greater scrutiny in light of Batson v. Kentucky, as these challenges could indicate an effort to shape a jury more inclined to disbelieve them. Finally, they argue that the cluster of mitigating factors surrounding their conduct—such as their longstanding commitment to political engagement and the potentially atypical nature of the prosecution—in combination with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) and U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0, justify a more lenient sentence or at least a downward departure.
