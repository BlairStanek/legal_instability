You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A trust was formed to facilitate a large secured financing arrangement for Grayson Air Solutions LLC, involving the sale of trust certificates to investors. Those proceeds were used by the trust to acquire a portion of Grayson Air Solutions LLC’s aircraft fleet, then leased back to Grayson Air Solutions LLC. The trust’s governing agreement, referred to in these proceedings as the Financing Document, specified that any additional rental amounts would revert to Grayson Air Solutions LLC once all obligations were paid. Upon complete payment, the trust would dissolve and return title to Grayson Air Solutions LLC.

 Various financial institutions served as trustees overseeing the trust’s management, including Brayton Bank as the Collateral Agent and others that acted as series trustees, such as Hawthorne National Bank, Sunset State Bank, and Meadow National Bank (later replaced by Brookline Bank). Certificateholders who had invested in the trust held rights to receive payments generated through the lease arrangements with Grayson Air Solutions LLC. After Grayson Air Solutions LLC defaulted on rental payments, the Collateral Agent took possession of numerous aircraft, leasing or selling them to protect the interests of the certificateholders.

 Harwood Investments Inc., composed of certain certificateholders, initiated an involuntary petition against the trust. Franklin Management LLC, along with some other trustees, contended that the trust was not eligible for bankruptcy relief because they viewed it as a mere vehicle for securing loans, rather than an entity formed to conduct business activities. The dispute centers on whether the trust’s purpose, structure, and functions classify it as a particular type of entity recognized by bankruptcy law as eligible for such proceedings.

 Arguments supporting Franklin Management LLC’s position describe the trust primarily as a protective arrangement designed to hold and safeguard collateral for the certificateholders rather than a business enterprise. They note the Financing Document’s emphasis on guaranteeing repayment of secured debt to investors, pointing out that any business-related steps taken—such as re-leasing or selling the equipment—are incidental to preserving and enforcing the underlying security. These arguments rely on provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that define eligible debtors in relation to whether an entity carries on commercial functions or is formed simply to protect assets. Citing the ordinary meaning of transacting business, they contend that the trust’s lease and sale activities do not transform it into a venture created for profit generation.

 Arguments supporting Harwood Investments Inc.’s position characterize the trust as an active enterprise that issues certificates of beneficial ownership, obtains significant assets, and leases or sells those assets to generate substantial returns for its investors. They emphasize the complicated scale of managing, maintaining, and marketing aircraft once Grayson Air Solutions LLC defaulted, pointing to continual and complex commercial operations well beyond simple asset preservation. By highlighting that the certificateholders entered the trust anticipating a profitable return, these arguments draw on case law indicating that if a trust conducts activities akin to a corporate venture, has beneficial owners with share-like interests, and engages in ongoing operations to produce those returns, it qualifies as a business trust under relevant statutes.
