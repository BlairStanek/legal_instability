You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Harper Collective brought a lawsuit under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, seeking certain materials from Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500. The dispute arose when Harper Collective requested access to documents that the group believed were important for internal union governance. Initially, Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500 did not provide everything requested.

 After the lawsuit was filed, Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500 turned over most of the documentation that Harper Collective wished to see. In the wake of that partial production, Harper Collective dropped its demand for the outstanding materials but then sought to recover attorneys’ fees from Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500, arguing that the filing of the case had prompted the release of the documents.

 Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500 asserted that it was more cost-effective to provide the requested records than to pursue lengthy court proceedings. Harper Collective contended that the documents’ disclosure was the direct result of its lawsuit and that it deserved compensation under a specific fee-shifting provision in the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Both sides focused on the statutory language addressing whether a judgment or some form of favorable court action might be required to receive attorneys’ fees.

 In support of Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500’s position, its arguments emphasize that the relevant statute contains language referring to fees awarded “in addition to any judgment.” This wording, the union suggests, underscores that a court-issued judgment must exist before fees can be granted. Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500 points to various statutory interpretations and case discussions where courts have examined whether a party must obtain concrete relief through an actual judgment rather than informal settlements. In referencing other fee-shifting statutes, it highlights the differences in phrasing: some laws prescribe fees to “prevailing parties,” while others specifically mention a “judgment.” Lyra Transport Workers Union Local 500 thus stresses that the text in question requires a judicial determination in the plaintiffs’ favor before fees may be shifted.

 In support of Harper Collective’s position, its arguments rely on the notion that the statute should be read in a way that encourages full disclosure and compliance with the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Harper Collective cites legislative references to fee-shifting provisions in similar contexts, noting that courts have sometimes awarded attorneys’ fees when the lawsuit itself meaningfully contributed to achieving the sought-after results, regardless of whether a formal judgment was entered. The group also points to the purpose of statutes protecting individual rights and internal democracy in unions, arguing that such context justifies a broader reading of the fee provision. According to Harper Collective, when a defendant’s voluntary compliance is prompted by a lawsuit, the practical outcome should be treated like a judicial victory, making an award of attorneys’ fees appropriate.
