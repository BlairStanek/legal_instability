You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Evelyn Hart brought an action in Michigan state court alleging false arrest, false imprisonment, emotional distress, and a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The complaint named Springdale, two of its officers (who were later served with process), and Brightvale as defendants. Although all claims arose under both state and federal law, the lawsuit commenced in Michigan, and service of process took place over a series of days in August and September.

 One of Springdale’s officers was the first to be served. Within roughly thirty days of service on that officer, a notice of removal was filed in the district court based on federal question jurisdiction. Afterward, the second officer and Springdale were also served and separately expressed their agreement to proceed in federal court. Brightvale received service at a later point but did not play a major role in the initial dispute about the removal’s timing.

 Even though Evelyn Hart did not formally contest whether the notice of removal complied with the relevant removal provisions in 28 U.S.C. § 1446, the district court on its own initiative remanded the matter to the state court for an alleged procedural defect in the removal process. The district court believed that the additional defendants did not timely consent after the first officer was served. A motion for reconsideration challenging the remand was subsequently denied, and further proceedings followed in an appellate forum.

 The Springdale Defendants assert that the removal should not be invalidated on procedural grounds and that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) does not authorize a court to remand a case on its own motion solely for a procedural defect. They emphasize that the first sentence of § 1447(c) refers to a “motion to remand” and thus places responsibility on a party to raise any alleged procedural flaw within the designated thirty-day window. They argue that this setup mirrors other waivable defects, like personal jurisdiction, and that a litigant can choose to remain in the federal forum even if a procedural irregularity occurred. In their view, ample case law, including discussions of Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer and similar authority, supports the proposition that the district court’s authority to act on its own is limited to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, rendering party-initiated motions necessary for procedural defects.

 By contrast, Evelyn Hart maintains that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) contemplates the district court’s ability to ensure compliance with removal requirements on the court’s own initiative. This position highlights that § 1447(c) once encompassed broader language—some of it still implicitly retained—and that courts have historically safeguarded proper procedural rules without a formal request by a party. Citing legislative history and certain judicial interpretations, this viewpoint asserts that timely and correct removal procedures serve not just the parties but also the orderly administration of justice, thus justifying proactive court oversight. Further, this position reasons that a district court faces no impediment to remanding for procedural discrepancy when adherence to the rules is evident, as courts should never permit departure from explicit statutory conditions for appearing in the federal forum.
