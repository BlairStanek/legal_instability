You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Aaron Ross was convicted of first-degree murder in a Nebraska state court in the late 1970s for an offense that took place the preceding year. Over more than a decade, he pursued numerous legal appeals and challenges at both the state and federal levels, each time disputing the validity of his death sentence. After these judicial attempts concluded, Ross asked the State of Nebraska Board of Pardons for commutation of his sentence from death to life imprisonment.

 In preparing to review Ross’s request for commutation, the Board held an informal public hearing. Throughout the hearing, Ross presented arguments for why his sentence should be reduced. Attorneys representing the State of Nebraska spoke in opposition to that request. The hearing procedures were not established by any specific statute governing capital clemency hearings; the Board used its discretionary authority to decide how to accept testimony and other submissions.

 Ross later filed an additional court action, arguing that the structure and procedures of the Board violated various federal constitutional rights. Among other points, he claimed that the attorney general, who had been involved in the prosecution, served on the very panel ruling on his commutation request. He also asserted that certain communications occurred between the attorney general and those who represented the State of Nebraska at the hearing, and that this made the overall process unfair. Ross further contended that the Board’s decision to allow counsel for the State of Nebraska to participate so actively, and to adopt hearing procedures soon before addressing his specific request, amounted to different treatment compared to other clemency applicants. The State of Nebraska countered that no mandatory procedural rules governed commutation matters, that the Board had wide discretion to decide how to evaluate each case, and that Ross had already received all the process due through his numerous prior trials and appeals.

 The primary legal arguments supporting the State of Nebraska’s position rely on precedents establishing that the scope of federal review is limited when a prisoner challenges procedures not directly tied to the initial sentencing or conviction. The State points to cases emphasizing that habeas corpus is traditionally used to contest custody that results from an unconstitutional conviction or sentence. According to this reasoning, the clemency process is a discretionary executive function, meaning it need not adhere to the same exact requirements that govern trials or sentencing phases. The State also highlights that when statutes or constitutions give an executive board complete discretion, courts have held that no substantive or procedural entitlements arise from this discretionary clemency power. Lastly, they contend that, in general, no federal constitutional right guarantees a neutral decisionmaker in an executive clemency proceeding, so inclusion of an attorney general in that process is consistent with accepted practice.

 In contrast, the principal arguments favoring Ross’s position assert that because executing a prisoner is the gravest possible outcome, the executive forum used to decide clemency must operate under at least minimal standards to satisfy constitutional protections. Ross contends that a chief prosecuting officer cannot fairly review a commutation request after having served in a role seeking the imposition of that same punishment, and that such overlap inherently undermines the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. He insists that maintaining any standard of reliability for deciding life-or-death matters requires, at the very least, an unbiased process. Ross further argues that certain precedents have recognized limited constitutional claims in contexts closely akin to commutation proceedings, particularly where the final decision is alleged to be influenced by persons who had previously participated in prosecution. Ross also emphasizes that his case is distinguishable from situations in which courts have ruled out procedural rights in clemency settings, highlighting that here, the Board adopted and employed tailored procedures right before his hearing, which he claims unfairly singled him out and deviated from historical practices involving other inmates.
