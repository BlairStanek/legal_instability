You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A vessel called the Trader-Belle was built for pushing multiple barges on the Glendale River. Its design included an area at the front with towknees rising above the prow to prevent the vessel from sliding under barges. There was also a narrow walkway around the cabin, equipped with a nylon safety line running through stanchions that could be lowered as needed. On the day relevant to this case, the Trader-Belle had facewires—sturdy steel cables—placed along the walkway after the vessel had disengaged from a group of barges. These facewires took up space on the walkway.

 Greg Wilson came on duty as a pilot at noon, taking over from Captain Larry Martin. At that time, the Trader-Belle was securely tied dockside. Observing that a segment of the safety line on the starboard side was down, Greg Wilson decided to restore it himself. As he proceeded to do so, he tripped, fell overboard, and was injured. Before this happened, the Trader-Belle had traveled from the area where it had left its barges to a refueling dock without having its starboard-side safety line put back in position.

 Testimony conflicted about the condition of the facewires. Greg Wilson contended these cables were frayed and had sharp spots that caught on his clothes or leg, causing him to lose balance. Witnesses for Carver Ships, Ltd. stated that the facewires were looped or bent but not burred. Regarding the safety line, there was evidence that it was often left down while docked, because repeated raising and lowering could pose additional hazards for the crew and interfere with tasks at hand. Greg Wilson argued that a missing or lowered safety line in that part of the deck always created a danger; others claimed that having it down while docked was reasonable practice in calm conditions.

 One set of arguments emphasizes that a vessel must be shown to have some genuine defect or unsafe condition to be deemed unseaworthy. Those presenting this position rely on cases stating that the standard is “reasonable fitness” for intended service, not perfection. They point to contrasting testimony that keeping the line down temporarily while the boat was docked did not render the vessel unfit, especially if crew members handled the stanchions and cables carefully. They rely on the idea that there is no absolute requirement to have guard rails up at all times, and that industry practice and experience can demonstrate whether the vessel was in a reasonably safe state. Under this formulation, there must be evidence of a genuine factual condition causing improper risk, beyond any alleged negligence by the injured individual.

 Another set of arguments focuses on the principle that a missing or defective safety device can render a vessel unseaworthy by creating a clear hazard. They cite decisions holding that removing or failing to install a guard rail or similar device can, by itself, make the vessel unfit for its intended use. The position is that leaving the safety line down for an extended period when the Trader-Belle moved from one location to another meant the vessel was already in an unsafe condition. Because the safety lines were meant to protect people working on the walkway, any failure to keep them in place while the vessel was operating or when crew members were on deck effectively deprived them of a needed safeguard. They also point to decisions suggesting that knowledge of the hazard by the injured party does not necessarily remove the unseaworthy condition or excuse the failure to cure it in a timely manner.
