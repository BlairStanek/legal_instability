You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Clark Howell filed a patent application disclosing a method for conducting an auction involving multiple related items. According to the application, the method allows bids on each individual item as well as on any combination of the items. The intent is to identify which combination or grouping of bids produces the best overall outcome, such as maximizing or minimizing total price, depending on the situation. The Patent and Trademark Office Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences reviewed this application and focused primarily on the nature of the claimed steps.

 The patent application describes how, in a hypothetical auction, different potential buyers place bids on various configurations of the items offered. Once all bids are collected, the method calls for determining which arrangement yields the best total value. This procedure may include mathematical calculations or summations to compare the revenue produced by different groupings of bids. The auctioneer (or whoever runs the process) then completes the sale using the chosen combination of bids. Clark Howell notes that this approach could be carried out in a single location or via communications technology connecting multiple auction venues.

 The Board, during the examination, examined whether these claimed steps defined subject matter eligible for patent protection. The Board observed that the method included receiving bids, entering them into a record, and ultimately selecting a combination of bids. The proximity of these actions to purely informational or computational procedures led the Board to question whether such a method is directed to an eligible process under patent law, or whether it is more akin to subject matter excluded from patentability. Clark Howell, by contrast, maintained that the claimed steps go beyond mere mental processes or unpatentable concepts, relying on the practical steps taken during the bidding and auction process.

 In support of the Patent and Trademark Office Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences winning, advocates stress that the method, in essence, consists of receiving and recording information, followed by a mathematical or logical determination to identify the best bid combination. They point to decisions such as Gottschalk v. Benson and Parker v. Flook, arguing that purely abstract or algorithmic steps, even when narrowed by data collection, remain outside the boundaries of 35 U.S.C. § 101. They emphasize that a series of additions, subtractions, or comparisons—even if physically entered into a ledger or display—does not necessarily constitute a transformation or reduction of an article as required under certain readings of case law. Additionally, they note that previous precedents have indicated methods involving mental or abstract processes can be unpatentable if no concrete or physical transformation is present. By highlighting references to established judicial exceptions, they maintain that subject matter centered on organizing bids and calculating optimal outcomes is fundamentally a non-statutory scheme, regardless of any incidental physical activity like writing down bids.

 In support of Clark Howell winning, advocates stress that the claims recite a process which includes a series of substantial steps beyond mere computation. They cite Diamond v. Diehr in arguing that the presence of a mathematical exercise does not automatically disqualify the invention from patent protection so long as the overall method is tied to a practical and tangible application. They draw attention to decisions such as Arrhythmia Research Technology, Inc. v. Corazonix Corp. and In re Abele, which underscore that a process can be statutory when data is meaningfully used or transformed in a real-world context. Advocates maintain that receiving bids, physically recording them, reorganizing the submitted information into different groupings, and actively determining which concrete combination of items is awarded to which bidder together constitute a technological process. They stress that ensuring the best auction outcome involves more than a purely abstract formula, arguing that the claims require active steps that yield real effects: items are definitively sold, and the arrangement among bidding participants is settled. By framing these steps as a tangible, outcome-oriented series of actions, they conclude that the invention is a valid process under 35 U.S.C. § 101.
