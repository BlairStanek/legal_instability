You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In April of 1992, Jordan Martin and an associate, Riley Norris, went into Valley Trust Bank in Grantville, Minnesota, where Martin grabbed the sole teller, held a knife, and announced a robbery. While Martin held the teller, Norris emptied the bank drawer. They locked the teller and a customer in a small room behind the teller area, fled the scene in a stolen vehicle, and were eventually apprehended later the same day in North Dakota.

 Jordan Martin pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) and (d). During the sentencing process, questions arose over whether Martin should be deemed a career offender, as defined in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, due to prior violent felonies. A key issue was whether one of Martin’s prior terms of imprisonment fell outside the fifteen-year period for counting a predicate conviction under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(e). After examining the dates, the district court concluded Martin’s prior conviction did not qualify for career offender treatment—an outcome that shifted the sentencing range down. The Government, however, sought an upward departure in light of Martin’s extensive record and other factors.

 The district court imposed a sentence above the initially calculated guidelines range, citing Martin’s significant criminal history and the psychological and emotional trauma experienced by the teller and the customer. On appeal, Martin argued that the district court already accounted for the robbery’s circumstances in enhancements and that the guidelines adequately addressed his actions. He further maintained that he did not receive sufficient notice as to an enhanced penalty for victim trauma, and that he should have been eligible for an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under the guidelines as amended at the time of his sentencing.

 In support of the sentence that was imposed, one side draws attention to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 and U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, pointing to Jordan Martin’s extensive and violent past, including crimes not captured in the routine criminal history calculation. Citing cases that recognize a defendant’s recidivist tendencies and the threat posed to public safety, this side emphasizes that the guidelines specifically allow an upward departure when the highest criminal history category still understates a defendant’s dangerousness. Regarding emotional harm to the victims, this side highlights U.S.S.G. § 5K2.3, which permits an increase for extreme psychological injury. According to this position, even if Martin received two-level or three-level enhancements for elements of the offense, those enhancements did not fully capture the lasting distress experienced by the victims, signaled by their ongoing symptoms and need for treatment. This group of arguments leans on precedent that underscores the discretionary power granted to the courts to consider harm above and beyond the norm for the base offense.

 Opposing that position, the other side contends that the guidelines already account for the essential features of Martin’s conduct, including the use of a dangerous weapon (under U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)) and the confinement of victims. This side refers to decisions stating that a “near miss” of a career offender classification, by itself, should not trigger a higher sentence if the prerequisites for career offender status are not fully met. Furthermore, it asserts that psychological effects on victims of an armed bank robbery, though serious, are often foreseeable parts of the crime and sufficiently covered by enhancements for restraining victims and brandishing a weapon. It also challenges the lack of explicit and timely notice about using psychological trauma as a separate departure factor, citing authority that such notice must be specific. Finally, it argues that Martin’s eventual guilty plea, though entered later in the process, still demonstrated acceptance of responsibility that might justify a greater reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), and that any denial of that reduction required stronger justification.
