You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Mr. Delaney was charged with six robberies in Westfield, Oklahoma. The Government pursued these charges under federal law, alleging that each robbery involved carrying a firearm and that the robberies affected interstate commerce. Mr. Delaney was tried before a jury on these counts. Both sides presented evidence concerning the items sold by the businesses that were robbed, and the nature of the businesses’ procurement of goods.

 Evidence was introduced that Mr. Delaney robbed “Lucky Corner” convenience store, purportedly taking about $800. “Lucky Corner” obtains many of the products it sells from “Twin Grocers,” a Westfield-based distributor that itself acquires merchandise from sources located in other states, including cigarettes and snack items. Mr. Delaney was similarly described as having robbed “Tolliver” gas station, which sells fuel and various other convenience items. Testimony indicated that “Tolliver” makes direct purchases from “the Clarkson Company,” based in Oak Hollow, Louisiana. According to witnesses, the money that was taken would otherwise have gone toward restocking goods.

 Additional evidence placed Mr. Delaney in robberies at “Bentley Stone Oil” station ($160), “DeMarco’s Pizza” ($300), and “Foster’s Food Mart” (between $350 and $500). In each instance, employees or owners testified that the money would have been used, at least in part, to purchase stock from out-of-state sources. Mr. Delaney was also alleged to have robbed “Miller’s Chicken House,” getting away with more than $1,500 in cash. The owner testified that this business buys chicken, breading, and other items from suppliers located in other states. Some witnesses indicated uncertainty about whether the robberies caused any direct reduction in the purchase of goods or whether the businesses compensated by using other funds. Others stated that any loss of money could potentially alter how often or how much they would normally spend on products shipped from outside Oklahoma.

 In arguing that Mr. Delaney’s conduct fell within federal jurisdiction, the Government cited 18 U.S.C. § 1951 and related provisions, stressing that any interference with or depletion of a company’s funds can suffice to show the required effect on interstate commerce. Relying on cases that recognized a broad sweep of authority under the Commerce Clause, the Government maintained that the movement and sale of products into a state are impacted whenever a robbery causes even a minor disruption of the flow of capital. According to these sources, a lender or supplier need not demonstrate a measurable drop in orders; it is enough that the business’s resources were reduced in a way that might limit its role as a purchaser of goods traveling across state lines. The Government pointed to judicial precedents holding that the Hobbs Act applies if the suspect’s actions “in any way or degree” interfere with interstate commerce, including potential or minimal impacts inferred from how the victim would ordinarily use its funds.

 Mr. Delaney countered that the Government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the robberies had an actual connection to commerce crossing state lines. Drawing on cases that frequently discuss the need for a “nexus” with interstate dealings, he argued that taking small sums of money from a business—even one that obtains some of its supplies from elsewhere—does not necessarily cause a genuine interference with commerce. Mr. Delaney contended that the Government’s reliance on a general “depletion of assets” theory was insufficient without more tangible evidence tying the specific robberies to an actual reduction in out-of-state purchases. Highlighting the uncertainties raised by store owners who admitted they might have bought the same amount of goods in subsequent months, he argued that the Government had not offered enough proof that any minimal depletion of one store’s assets would realistically impact overall purchases. He urged that purely speculative or theoretical effects on commerce cannot satisfy the requirement that interstate commerce must be “actually or potentially” affected.
