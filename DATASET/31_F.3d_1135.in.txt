You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Marcelus Power Corporation is an affiliated group of companies using the accrual method of accounting. One of its members, Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC, manufactured a chemical defoliant called Project Citrus during the Vietnam War era. Numerous veterans sued Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC and other companies, alleging injuries arising out of exposure to Project Citrus. In 1984, several companies, including Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC, reached a class action settlement before the district court. Under that settlement, Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC was to pay a specified portion into a settlement fund, once final court approval was obtained.

 Marcelus Power Corporation deducted certain settlement-related amounts during its 1984 and 1985 tax years, then carried the losses back to earlier tax years. The Internal Revenue Service disagreed with the deductions and disallowed refund claims for the earlier years. Marcelus Power Corporation relied on the settlement agreement and on the necessity of obtaining a letter of credit from Redwood Bank to secure the payment. The settlement allowed the settling companies, including Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC, a brief period to withdraw from the agreement if they chose. In the end, Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC did not withdraw and eventually paid into the settlement fund. Disputes arose about whether and when the liability to pay the settlement fund became “fixed,” how the letter of credit from Redwood Bank affected the timing of the deduction, and whether the payment to the settlement fund could support a deduction before the individual claimants were actually paid.

 Marcelus Power Corporation filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, pursuing refunds for multiple years. Some issues unrelated to the Project Citrus deductions were settled between Marcelus Power Corporation and The United States. A joint stipulation led to dismissal of portions of the claims. Questions then emerged about the precise effect of that stipulation and the timing of the eventual final judgment. One central disagreement centered on whether the letter of credit from Redwood Bank was fully collateralized or not, and on whether the right to withdraw from the settlement agreement meant that the liability had not yet been fixed for purposes of deduction. Further points in dispute included whether making a payment to the settlement fund, rather than directly to individual claimants, fulfilled the relevant “economic performance” standard once certain statutes had gone into effect.

 Marcelus Power Corporation contends that its liability became certain as soon as the settlement agreement was executed and once the short withdrawal window closed, making the obligation irrevocably set. It argues that the letter of credit from Redwood Bank, fully secured by funds outside its control, qualifies as a proper method of satisfying a contested liability under applicable statutes and regulations, relying on interpretations of I.R.C. § 461(f) and on case law such as Chem Aero, Inc. v. United States. Marcelus Power Corporation also asserts that once the agreed-upon funds were ultimately transferred into the settlement fund, that transfer fully discharged any liabilities to individual claimants, meaning there was no further need to wait until the fund distributed money to class members. Concerning I.R.C. § 468B, Marcelus Power Corporation points to language in that provision and its legislative history indicating that it does not apply where a contested liability is resolved in a format other than a designated settlement fund, and it emphasizes that the creation of a transfer beyond its control, coupled with the final approval of the class settlement, should have entitled it to claim valid deductions.

 The United States counters that the letter of credit from Redwood Bank did not fulfill the requirement that the money or property be conclusively outside Marcelus Power Corporation’s control if that letter of credit was not fully collateralized. Moreover, the United States maintains that if Emerald Shamrock Solutions LLC retained the right to withdraw from the settlement agreement through a certain date, then the liability was not fixed until that date passed, which was after new statutory requirements under I.R.C. § 461(h) took effect. The United States notes that I.R.C. § 461(h) mandates economic performance, which, under a plain reading of that statute, involves payments either directly to claimants or to a designated settlement fund. According to the United States, if the payment was merely to a general settlement fund without the status required by I.R.C. § 468B, the liability could not be deducted when the money was placed there, unless the amount became disbursed to claimants or a designated arrangement existed. Finally, because the settlement agreement’s finality was subject to court approval and potential appeals, the United States argues that the timing for when the liability truly vested was more complicated than Marcelus Power Corporation suggests, undermining the claim that deductions were appropriate in the specific years asserted.
