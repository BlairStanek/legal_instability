You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Ryan Johnson began working for the Postal Inspection Service in 1971. In August of 1984, his immediate supervisor, Mark Robinson, gave him a positive performance evaluation, which was then changed by a higher-level supervisor, Paul White, to a lower rating. Johnson believed that White’s actions were prompted by Johnson’s assistance to a coworker in that coworker’s discrimination-related concerns. Shortly thereafter, White instructed Johnson to move from the Fraud Section to the Audit Section. Johnson felt unprepared for and demeaned by this new role. Despite White’s directive to report on a specified date, Johnson refused.

 Because Johnson did not follow the instruction to assume the new Audit Section responsibilities, White placed him in an off-duty status. Johnson was told that this would remain in effect unless he complied with the reassignment. Johnson never reported to the Audit Section, and White formally charged him with insubordination. Ultimately, Johnson’s position with the Postal Service ended. Johnson believed that all of this stemmed from retaliation for his prior assistance to a coworker in pursuing discrimination claims.

 Johnson pursued administrative and legal channels, asserting that the reassignment and subsequent termination were retaliatory. David Lake maintained that Johnson’s refusal to comply with a direct work instruction justified the action taken against him, pointing to the importance of discipline and morale within the Postal Inspection Service. These disputes focused on whether the reassignment was simply a neutral employment decision and whether the end of Johnson’s employment with the Postal Service resulted from lawful enforcement of workplace rules or from an improper desire to punish Johnson for protected conduct.

 In support of David Lake, legal arguments invoked anti-discrimination statutes such as 29 U.S.C. § 623(d) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), citing decisions emphasizing that an employer may legitimately remove a worker who defies a clear directive, even if the worker has engaged in some protected activity. Such arguments highlight that insubordination, where an employee refuses a standard reassignment, can be a permissible, nondiscriminatory reason for discharge. They invoke caselaw discussing how legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationales—once articulated—shift the burden to the employee to show such reasons are pretextual. Citing the importance of managerial discretion and the need for employees to obey work assignments, these contentions assert that an employer preserves a legitimate interest in maintaining morale and discipline. They further reference precedents which hold that purely refusing to obey an unwanted order, without exhausting internal complaint processes or continuing under protest, can constitute unprotected behavior.

 In support of Ryan Johnson, legal arguments rely on the principle that statutes protecting individuals from discrimination also shield them from workplace retaliation for assisting or opposing such discrimination. They reference Title VII’s and other anti-retaliation provisions’ requirement that an employee not be disadvantaged for aiding a colleague’s legal claims. Johnson’s position reasons that the downgrading of his performance evaluation and the abrupt reassignment to the Audit Section, for which he felt wholly unprepared, amounted to a severe response driven by retaliatory motive. Further bolstering this argument, certain authorities are cited for the proposition that an employee should not be forced to obey manifestly improper directives and that refusing to comply with such orders may, in some circumstances, qualify as protected opposition. Johnson’s side also references cases in which reassignment to a position of considerably lesser stature was seen as evidence of potential retaliation, especially if close in time to a worker’s protected activity.
