You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


George and Michael Caldwell owned a two-story building located at 45 Lake Street in Northville, Connecticut. This structure contained four legal dwelling units, each with four bedrooms opening onto a hall and shared kitchen. Over several years, George and Michael Caldwell rented individual bedrooms to different occupants and expressed concerns to law enforcement about illicit activities occurring in common areas of the building. The Caldwell owners gave the police written permission to address trespassing in or around the premises, along with keys to external doors.

 Karen Davis and Robert Davis were two tenants in one of these dwelling units. They regularly used one bedroom but were told by the owners they could use additional rooms until new renters arrived. One such room had no door; in that room, John Clark—Karen Davis’s brother—spent a night along with another visitor, Emily Parker.

 On a morning visit, local police officers who had been patrolling the property spoke with Robert Davis in the shared kitchen and proceeded to where John Clark and Emily Parker were sleeping. During the ensuing encounter, officers discovered a firearm and ammunition near John Clark. The Government subsequently charged John Clark under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), alleging he unlawfully possessed a firearm and ammunition due to his criminal record. John Clark moved to suppress the seized evidence, asserting that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

 In support of its position, the Government cites principles permitting warrantless searches pursued with valid consent, referring to holdings in cases such as United States v. Matlock and Illinois v. Rodriguez. The Government contends that the Caldwell owners had provided ongoing consent to search portions of the building they either controlled outright or shared in common with tenants. Given the building’s history as a rooming house with locked and unlocked rooms, the Government maintains that it was objectively reasonable to rely on consent provided by the owners for law enforcement to enter spaces that were not clearly leased or that still were under the owners’ authority. According to this view, the officers’ belief that they had permission to enter and inspect for trespassers and other misconduct was not legally infirm, especially in light of the owners’ longstanding practice of giving the police keys and asking them to check for unauthorized occupants.

 Opposing the Government, John Clark relies on Fourth Amendment protections requiring valid, individualized consent before the police enter any space serving as a private residence. Citing Chapman v. United States and other cases, John Clark argues that a landlord generally lacks authority to permit entry into a tenant’s dwelling or its immediately associated living areas. He contends that the bedroom he was using qualifies as part of a broader apartment space under the exclusive or shared domain of Karen Davis and Robert Davis, meaning the Caldwell owners had no ongoing right to authorize police access there. John Clark therefore urges that any reliance on the landlord’s “open-ended” consent was unreasonable. He asserts further that his status as an overnight guest endowed him with a protectable privacy interest, making the entry without a warrant improper under established precedents.
