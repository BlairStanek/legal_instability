You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Christopher Martinez worked as a spray painter for Everett Manufacturing from mid-May 1989 to late July 1989. On a near-daily basis during that time, he used various paint products supplied by Leland Industries Corp. Shortly after he began working with these products, he experienced physical symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, chest tightness, and coughing. He reported several instances of feeling ill to his supervisor, and these types of symptoms persisted.

 Martinez filed a lawsuit on June 13, 1991, in the circuit court of Armitage City, Virginia. He alleged that Leland Industries Corp. had failed to warn him adequately of the potential dangers associated with its paint products and had breached certain warranties, both express and implied. Leland Industries Corp. moved the case to the district court. In that forum, the company asserted that Martinez’s claims were brought too late, more than two years after he initially experienced his alleged injuries.

 In addition to his early symptoms, Martinez also pointed to an incident on June 13, 1989, when he noticed his mask was torn, causing him to inhale a significant amount of fumes. He sought treatment that day at Hazelton Hospital. He believed this incident contributed to or worsened the symptoms that he had been experiencing. Leland Industries Corp. asserted that Martinez’s initial complaints, which occurred well before June 13, should control any assessment of when his cause of action arose. Both sides presented arguments concerning whether a new, independent injury occurred on June 13 or whether the problem was simply part of a single, continuous course of harm that began weeks earlier.

 In favor of Christopher Martinez, it is argued that the law recognizes injury claims from the date an injury is “sustained.” Martinez contends that each exposure to hazardous paint fumes constituted a separate harm, triggering new injury dates. He emphasizes that his visit to Hazelton Hospital on June 13 shows an additional physical impact. Legal authorities are cited for the proposition that continuous harmful exposure can be seen as multiple actionable events, especially if distinct physical harm occurs after the first incident. Martinez also maintains that under established precedent, if any of his allegations arise from a later point in time—such as the June 13 exposure—then the filing of his lawsuit within two years of that date should be considered timely for those injuries. He highlights that the cause of action accrues at each moment of harm, and he relies on cases stating that the date of injury is critical for limitations purposes, rather than the date of an initial discovery only.

 In favor of Leland Industries Corp., it is argued that under state law, a personal injury claim must be brought within two years of when the claimant first experiences any positive physical harm. The company asserts that because Martinez admitted he began feeling sick in May, he knew or should have known of his injuries at that time. They cite decisions explaining that even minor harm triggers the start of the statute of limitations period, and once it has begun, it is not renewed by subsequent exposures or additional injuries arising out of the same alleged wrongful conduct. Further, cases are referenced for the proposition that, ordinarily, where an individual has already sustained an injury due to a product, later harm from continued use of that product does not restart the clock for limitations purposes unless there is some distinct, legally separate basis for recovery. Consequently, Leland Industries Corp. maintains that Martinez’s action is time-barred because May 1989 was the crucial point of initial injury.
