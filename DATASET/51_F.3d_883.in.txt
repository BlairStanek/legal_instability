You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Savory Foods, Inc. entered bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11, and its president, Ali Hussein, performed tasks that purportedly aided the preservation of Savory Foods, Inc.’s estate. The bankruptcy court allowed Ali Hussein to claim certain administrative expenses for his services. Later, the Chapter 11 proceeding converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation, and David Miller was appointed as trustee. At a time when the estate still had assets, the Service asserted that Ali Hussein owed substantial tax liabilities, and it served David Miller with a notice of levy directed at Ali Hussein’s allowed administrative expense claims.

 The court orders approving Ali Hussein’s administrative expenses were phrased so that his claims could be paid only under further court direction, and the precise amount he would receive ultimately depended upon the estate’s available assets once liquidation was complete. David Miller eventually liquidated those assets and proposed a final distribution that included a sum for Ali Hussein. Although the Service had served its levy earlier, David Miller did not turn over any portion of Ali Hussein’s administrative claims to the Service at that time.

 The Service later issued a final demand when it learned that David Miller had distributed funds to Ali Hussein. David Miller took the position that, at the time of the notice of levy, he was not in possession of or obligated on a definite amount to be paid to Ali Hussein because any such sum remained conditional on the estate’s final accounting and the bankruptcy court’s authorization of the proposed distribution. The dispute between the Service and David Miller centered on whether the Service’s levy required immediate surrender of the administrative expense claims or whether David Miller could distribute those funds to Ali Hussein without personal liability.

 On one side, it is argued that an allowed administrative expense claim is property or a right to property within the meaning of tax collection provisions. This view relies on the broad scope of 26 U.S.C. § 6321 and related authorities, which grant the government a lien on all property, and on 26 C.F.R. § 301.6331-1(a)(1), which is said to require anyone obligated on a fixed and determinable liability to surrender such property or face personal liability. The argument emphasizes that once a claim is allowed for services already performed, the liability to pay is effectively fixed by law, even if payment itself can occur only when the bankruptcy court finally approves disbursement. Proponents of this view invoke the principle that an administrative levy is designed to be a prompt mechanism for collection, so it should attach to obligations that have already vested in the individual, though held for later payout by a trustee. They maintain that requiring the Service to wait for later developments in the bankruptcy case would undercut the prompt and comprehensive nature of the levy power.

 On the other side, it is argued that the trustee should not be personally liable because, at the time the notice of levy was issued, there was no fixed and determinable sum owed to Ali Hussein. Supporters of this position claim that the bankruptcy court’s orders granting administrative expense status did not establish an unconditional right to immediate payment, but merely recognized a possible entitlement once the estate’s assets were marshaled and the ultimate portions payable were precisely calculated. They point out that important conditions still had to be met, such as a showing of sufficient estate funds and final court approval of the specific distribution. They also invoke the automatic stay in bankruptcy, asserting that the stay prohibits collection actions against the estate’s property without the court’s permission. They raise equitable arguments such as laches or estoppel, maintaining that the Service’s silence during the trustee’s notice of proposed distribution and its delay in objecting or in filing suit suggested that no immediate turnover was due, and that the trustee was led to believe that such distribution would not cause personal liability.
