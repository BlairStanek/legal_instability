You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Lawrence Stone received notice from the Internal Revenue Service that it proposed assessing a 100% penalty under 26 U.S.C. § 6672 related to unpaid withholding and employee tax amounts by a firm known at the time as Sentry Tools Inc. Stone was an officer, stockholder, and general manager of Sentry Tools Inc., with signature authority over the company’s operating account. The proposed penalties totaled nearly fifty thousand dollars.

 Stone sought to appeal the proposed assessment administratively, but the Internal Revenue Service deemed his appeals invalid because he gave no reasons for disputing the charge. Some time after Stone filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court, the Internal Revenue Service took steps to collect the penalty. Both parties acknowledged this collection effort might have violated the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court reflecting the penalties at issue. Stone, for his part, drew the agency’s attention to a pending sale of property, as well as the possibility of converting his bankruptcy from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7.

 The case was indeed converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation, and Stone was ultimately granted a discharge of certain debts in the bankruptcy court. Because the 100% penalty is considered non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, Stone remained personally liable for it. As time passed, the Internal Revenue Service did not remove or recalculate the penalty, and a notice of federal lien was eventually filed. Stone made several payments toward the penalty and, at one stage, agreed to extend the time for collection. Later, he claimed a right to a refund of the amounts he had paid, disputing the continuing validity of the penalty due to its original imposition during the automatic stay period.

 In support of its position, the Government contends that an action taken in technical violation of the automatic stay is not inevitably void if it does not thwart the essence and objectives of bankruptcy law. It emphasizes that the Bankruptcy Code does not automatically invalidate the assessment of taxes and penalties whenever a stay is in place. The Government points to legislative history suggesting that certain tax assessments need not follow the usual deficiency-processing steps, especially where the matter would belong in the bankruptcy forum regardless. It also highlights statutory and interpretive sources that permit the bankruptcy court to retroactively validate or annul certain actions taken without its consent. Furthermore, it emphasizes that the single-forum nature of a proceeding involving a 100% penalty does not impose additional burdens on the debtor and, as such, does not undermine the protective policy behind the stay. Several references to statutory coordination between federal tax provisions and the Bankruptcy Code bolster the Government’s view that this type of penalty assessment can stand.

 Stone, in contrast, focuses on the protective breadth of the automatic stay. He argues that, under classic bankruptcy principles and relevant precedent, the stay prevents all collection and assessment efforts without court approval, so any action taken in violation of it should be deemed void from the outset. Stone points to long-standing Supreme Court authority, interpreting earlier bankruptcy laws, that declared post-petition collection actions null and subject to collateral attack, concluding that the fundamental nature of the stay has remained intact. He further notes that Congress has carefully enumerated exceptions to the stay, and if assessment of this type were meant to be allowed despite the stay, it would have been explicitly exempted or authorized. Stone contends that presuming a stay violation could later be forgiven would force debtors such as himself to be constantly vigilant against unlawful creditor actions, undermining their ability to stabilize or reorganize during bankruptcy. He underscores that because the Internal Revenue Service still had legal avenues post-bankruptcy, it had no justification for proceeding without a court order while the stay was in effect.
