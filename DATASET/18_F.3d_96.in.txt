You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Matthew Kelly, a long-serving science teacher, was employed by Merrick Union Free School District for nearly two decades. According to the record, he was previously charged with certain disciplinary violations, including one involving an unauthorized field trip using an aircraft and another concerning an ignited aerosol spray in a school cafeteria. These earlier allegations led to financial penalties and a suspension. Subsequently, an election was held at Forest Lake High School—part of Merrick Union Free School District—to choose members of the Board of Education and vote on a budget.

 On the date of the election, there was a state law, New York State Education Law § 2031-a, prohibiting certain electioneering activities within 100 feet of the polling place. It was undisputed that no physical signs or distance markers had been placed to identify where the 100-foot boundary ended. Later that day, after Matthew Kelly’s regular work time had ended, he began distributing flyers that were critical of the election process and of Board incumbents. He stood on the steps of Forest Lake High School, which some witnesses estimated to be about 41 feet from the entrance. Several administrators, including the Superintendent (Dr. David Gray), the District Clerk (Ms. Morgan Smith), and the Business Administrator (Mr. Henry Wilson), noticed Matthew Kelly’s activities and confronted him, insisting that the law required him to move 100 feet away.

 Police officers, summoned by the district’s administrators, arrived to address the situation. They explained to Matthew Kelly that the law barred electioneering within 100 feet of the entrance. On two occasions, officers guided him to stand further away. Confusion persisted about the precise location where the boundary line fell because no markers had been posted and there was no measurement made. Despite repeated warnings from the school district officials that the steps were inside the restricted zone, Matthew Kelly intermittently returned to the entrance area, believing he was permitted to campaign closer to the building or questioning where the line ended. Disciplinary charges were later brought against Kelly, alleging multiple violations of the electioneering prohibition on that day.

 One set of legal arguments focuses on Matthew Kelly’s contention that there was insufficient notice of where the 100-foot boundary lay, thus denying him clarity about lawful campaigning locations. He cites New York State Education Law § 2031-a, pointing to the requirement that actual distance markers be placed to inform voters and participants of the permissible and prohibited zones. Kelly argues that without the markers, neither he nor others could know where the prohibited zone ended, and this omission risked both arbitrariness in enforcement and the chilling of constitutionally protected speech. Further, he contends that the circumstances of his past disagreements with district administrators suggest that they targeted him due to personal conflicts, therefore reinforcing the possibility of unfair or selective enforcement.

 Another set of legal arguments supports the position of Merrick Union Free School District. These arguments emphasize that the state law clearly prohibits campaigning within 100 feet, regardless of whether distance markers are physically posted. From this viewpoint, the statute’s text imposes the electioneering restriction outright, and the absence of posted markers does not negate the prohibition. District representatives maintain that Matthew Kelly had been repeatedly told—and then shown by law enforcement—that the entrance steps were within the forbidden distance. Thus, once he received these verbal warnings and was escorted to a lawful spot, he could not claim ignorance of the boundary. Therefore, these arguments conclude, the school district had ample justification to pursue disciplinary action for repeated disregard of a well-known prohibition that was explained to him on multiple occasions.
