You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Redwood Foundries, Inc. operated a facility in Seaburg, Florida, where work-related noise levels were measured as equaling or exceeding an eight-hour time-weighted average of eighty-five decibels. The Secretary of Labor conducted an inspection of that facility and concluded that Redwood Foundries, Inc. was required to implement and maintain certain monitoring and testing measures. Redwood Foundries, Inc. was aware of these requirements through federal regulations applicable to workplaces with high occupational noise exposure.

 Instead of following the precise steps outlined by the relevant regulations, Redwood Foundries, Inc. required employees to wear hearing protectors in all parts of its facility at all times. Redwood Foundries, Inc. believed this approach rendered formal audiometric testing unnecessary. In the period before the Secretary of Labor’s inspection, Redwood Foundries, Inc. had obtained similar measurements indicating noise exposure above the threshold and still declined to introduce a full monitoring program or baseline audiograms. For several years, Redwood Foundries, Inc. did not seek a government-approved variance but tried to manage noise through its own procedures.

 The Secretary of Labor subsequently issued a citation, asserting that Redwood Foundries, Inc. had violated federal standards by not establishing a comprehensive hearing-monitoring program, including required baseline and annual audiograms. Redwood Foundries, Inc. contested the citation on grounds that its alternative approach offered equal or greater protection than the regulatory measures. Around the same time, Redwood Foundries, Inc. pursued a variance to allow it to continue its self-created program but did so only after the citation had already been issued. Additional facts showed that Redwood Foundries, Inc. had dealt with noise-related citations at other locations in Dunham, Oklahoma, and Pineville, Arkansas, and had similarly argued that it provided effective safeguards without strict adherence to the exact regulatory scheme.

 For the Secretary of Labor, the arguments in favor of finding Redwood Foundries, Inc. responsible for a regulatory breach rest on the clear language of the federal standards, which mandate that employers must adhere to the specific requirements of 29 U.S.C. § 654 and the detailed provisions of 29 C.F.R. § 1910.95. The Secretary of Labor’s position emphasizes the statutory obligation that each employer must comply with occupational safety and health rules as written, without unilateral substitutions. Citing cases interpreting “willfulness” or disregard under workplace-safety statutes, the Secretary of Labor argues that awareness of the rule and its applicability establishes a legal duty to follow that rule unless a proper variance is formally granted. The Secretary of Labor also references decisions that explain how an employer’s belief in an internal solution is irrelevant if the employer knowingly departed from mandatory regulations. From the Secretary’s perspective, Redwood Foundries, Inc. could have followed the variance procedure, under 29 U.S.C. § 655(d), if it wanted to implement a tailored noise-protection method, thereby lawfully providing its own alternative approach. Because it did not do so in a timely manner, its knowledge of the regulations and its acknowledged divergence from them together support the view that Redwood Foundries, Inc. must answer for noncompliance.

 In response, Redwood Foundries, Inc. offers arguments that center on its belief that it met or surpassed the ultimate goal of protecting employees from noise-induced hearing loss. It points to its year-round requirement for hearing protectors, which Redwood Foundries, Inc. claims reduced employees’ exposure below the regulatory threshold. It maintains that this approach prevented any measurable hearing damage, rendering periodic audiograms unnecessary. Redwood Foundries, Inc. also argues that compliance with the regulation’s precise monitoring scheme was impractical or infeasible due to the changing locations of employees throughout the facility. In Redwood Foundries, Inc.’s view, these considerations gave it genuine grounds to think that the mandatory standard did not neatly align with its working environment. Redwood Foundries, Inc. further contends that its interpretation of how to comply with 29 C.F.R. § 1910.95 was legitimate, noting that the regulation could be read as allowing alternatives that achieved the same or better protection for workers. Consequently, Redwood Foundries, Inc. believes that its judgment—based on reading the regulation and implementing a uniform practice of hearing protection—constitutes a reasonable basis for concluding that full conformity with the testing and monitoring requirements was not required.
