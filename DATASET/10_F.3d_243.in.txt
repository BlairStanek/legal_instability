You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In April 1983, Barry Solutions, Inc. purchased certain land and assets from Paulson Enterprises, including an underground tank farm comprised of at least 42 tanks. The tank farm was located in Linden, Johnson County, Florida. Barry Solutions, Inc. negotiated for an indemnification provision in the sales contract, given concerns about potential environmental liability tied to historical operations on the site.

 In the spring of 1985, a local government agency issued a notice requiring water-quality monitoring at the tank farm. Barry Solutions, Inc. discovered signs of contamination after installing monitoring wells, prompting a violation notice in May 1985 that directed the company to undertake corrective measures. Barry Solutions, Inc. tried bailing operations through November 1985 but received another directive that month to test all underground tanks and propose a remedial plan. By early 1986, testing revealed several leaking tanks. Barry Solutions, Inc. eventually notified Paulson Enterprises in writing about the issue in late February 1986.

 After learning that a number of the tanks were leaking, Barry Solutions, Inc. considered how best to respond to the contamination and submitted proposals to address the situation. Disagreement arose about the full extent of the costs covered by any indemnification, especially where it concerned the removal of tanks that were not leaking, as well as the additional expense of installing new storage capacity. Meanwhile, both sides examined whether the 60-day contractual notification provision had been satisfied.

 Paulson Enterprises contends that the unambiguous language of the indemnification and notice provisions strictly governs whether indemnity applies. Drawing on principles outlined in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins and the interpretive standard of DEC Electric, Inc. v. Raphael Constr. Corp., it supports a view that the contractâ€™s text requires an indemnitee to give notice of any claim within 60 days from the moment a government agency or other source formally asserts a claim. Paulson Enterprises further cites cases holding that, absent explicit contractual language, a discovery-based delaying of deadlines should not be read into a private agreement between two business entities. As a result, Paulson Enterprises maintains that once a clear demand for remediation is issued, the clock for notice runs immediately, with no implied delay to wait for discovery or confirmation of damages.

 Barry Solutions, Inc. argues that under Florida law, various decisions have applied a discovery rule to determine when a claimant should have reasonably recognized that a legal right was violated. Citing Senfeld v. Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Co. and Creviston v. General Motors Corp., Barry Solutions, Inc. posits that these principles support giving an indemnitee a fair opportunity to discover both the scope of the contamination and the basis for indemnification before the clock on notice begins. Barry Solutions, Inc. also draws parallels between the indemnification clause and typical insurance arrangements where Florida courts have sometimes allowed flexibility regarding strict notice timelines. According to this view, Barry Solutions, Inc. asserts that its notification was timely because it was provided within 60 days of discovering the true nature and extent of the underlying claim, thereby ensuring a fair chance to determine whether indemnification under the agreement was triggered.
