You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Baxter was charged under federal law with conspiracy to distribute, or possess with intent to distribute, a controlled substance. Three specific transactions formed part of the charges against him. The first occurred when an undercover law enforcement officer arrived at Baxter’s home in Greenville, Vermont, and a confidential intermediary briefly stepped out of sight to purchase a small quantity of cocaine from Baxter, then resold it to the officer. The second transaction took place when the same undercover officer approached Baxter seeking to buy more cocaine; Baxter made phone calls to potential suppliers in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, then traveled with the officer to Riverton, Massachusetts, returning to Vermont with a quantity of cocaine. The third arose from another visit to Baxter’s home by undercover officers, who purchased a separate quantity of cocaine that had been supplied by another individual.

 In addition to these charged transactions, federal agents investigated Baxter’s possible involvement in uncharged deals with three individuals: Henderson, Foley, and Blake. According to law enforcement interviews, Henderson said he had repeatedly been Baxter’s supplier and that Baxter owed an outstanding sum for a fronted amount of narcotics. Foley and Blake were also reported to have supplied Baxter on multiple occasions. Investigators recorded a conversation in which Henderson and Baxter discussed unpaid money for a drug front, and Baxter indicated caution about future dealings.

 During a meeting with a probation officer in preparation for sentencing, Baxter denied any involvement beyond the three acknowledged transactions. He was specifically asked about contacts with Henderson, Foley, and Blake, and whether he had acquired drugs from them in any additional deals. Baxter denied doing so, categorically stating he had made no other cocaine purchases. Based on these statements, the Government asserted that Baxter had provided false information relevant to the scope of his offense. At sentencing, the district court weighed whether these denials and omissions should affect Baxter’s punishment under the rules for those who impede official proceedings.

 In support of Baxter, it has been argued that individuals charged with criminal conduct are permitted to deny wrongdoing, both under constitutional guarantees and broader legal principles. Baxter’s supporters rely on authorities indicating that not every misleading or incomplete statement qualifies as a willful obstruction, especially when it is essentially a denial of guilt rather than a separate fabrication meant to shield unrelated third parties or shift blame. Legal precedent is invoked to illustrate that sentencing provisions should not penalize a refusal to confess to uncharged aspects of alleged wrongdoing unless such refusals go beyond a simple denial and amount to independent interference with the administration of justice. Some authorities emphasize that a defendant’s unsworn denials regarding specific additional allegations are protected if the defendant seeks merely to avoid self-incrimination under the statutes and case law governing conspiracies and sentencing enhancements.

 In support of the Government, it has been argued that providing materially false information to a probation officer during the sentencing phase can constitute an effort to undermine an accurate determination of punishment. Under this view, statements that deny significant facts—particularly facts bearing on the defendant’s overall culpability—hinder the judicial process in a way that standard protections for mere denials of guilt do not shield. The Government’s position cites statutory provisions and prior cases establishing that the sentencing court must receive truthful information regarding all relevant conduct, and that knowingly providing false material information is tantamount to obstructing justice. The Government further contends that the rights of the accused do not extend to making deliberate misrepresentations to the court’s officers, and nothing in the relevant statutes or controlling precedents suggests that the law places such falsehoods beyond the reach of enhanced penalties.
