You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Hudson, Wyatt & Jenkins Employees Trust is an employee trust fund subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. It was created by Hudson, Wyatt & Jenkins, a professional corporation of certified public accountants, and overseen by two trustees, Robert Scott and Mark Jonas. These trustees developed a working relationship with Michael Rivera, who later formed a general partnership called Sunrise Funding with Charles Hughes to locate and sell deed of trust notes secured by real property. Over time, a significant portion of the trust’s overall portfolio came to consist of notes obtained through Sunrise Funding.

 In the course of this relationship, the trust acquired numerous deed of trust notes from Sunrise Funding for use as part of its investment strategy; these transactions ultimately totaled over $700,000, representing around 40% of the trust’s assets. Among these were four specific notes known as the Logan, Mason, Burton, and Collins notes. The trust later alleged that Sunrise Funding had disclosed inaccurate information about three of these notes, leading to financial losses it sought to recover.

 Some descriptions portray the trust, which included experienced accountants among its personnel, as aiming for a high rate of return on its investments, eventually facing setbacks when the local real estate market declined. Others cite that the trust placed confidence in Rivera’s property-related assertions—such as the valuations of the real estate, the creditworthiness of payors, and the precise nature of the property locations. Conflicting views arose over whether the trust independently examined these properties and whether Rivera’s statements were material to the trust’s decisions. Another point of contention was whether Rivera’s role was purely to sell Sunrise Funding’s products or, instead, to offer specialized guidance suited to the trust’s overall goals, diversification needs, and strategy.

 In support of Hudson, Wyatt & Jenkins Employees Trust’s position, advocates have argued that the operative statutory definition of fiduciary under 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A)(ii) is sufficiently broad to cover anyone who renders investment advice for a fee to an ERISA-regulated plan. Drawing on the Department of Labor’s regulations at 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-21(c)(1), they have asserted that providing individualized recommendations or advice as to the value of securities, pursuant to a mutual understanding that the advice will be used as a primary basis for investing, creates a fiduciary relationship. They further point out that courts have construed ERISA’s definition of fiduciary expansively, citing precedent that looks to whether a person regularly makes recommendations specific to the plan’s needs and receives compensation for those recommendations. By characterizing the trust’s reliance on Rivera’s statements—particularly those concerning property value, location, and payor reliability—as central to the trust’s decisions, they maintain that Rivera functioned as an investment advisor. Supporters of this view additionally note that any fee or profit derived indirectly from such transactions satisfies ERISA’s requirement for receiving compensation, rendering a person subject to fiduciary responsibilities and liable for any material misrepresentations or omissions that cause harm to the plan.

 Those supporting Rivera’s position counter that under established precedent, including cases like Farm King Supply v. Edward D. Jones & Co. and Consolidated Beef Indus., Inc. v. New York Life Ins. Co., a person who merely sells or brokers a particular financial product—particularly one that originates from the seller’s own inventory—does not automatically become a fiduciary under ERISA. They argue that an actual mutual agreement or understanding to provide individualized investment advice, with the seller acting as the primary decision-making resource for the plan, is required. Advocates for Rivera insist that, in this situation, the trust was administered by knowledgeable professionals who managed their investments in a way that cannot be characterized as blindly reliant on one seller’s representations. They contend that simply giving promotional information, describing properties, and offering them for sale does not equate to fulfilling the specific, individualized advisory role required by 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A). Citing case law where courts declined to characterize routine commissions as fiduciary fees, they argue that profits generated from reselling notes do not necessarily transform the seller into a plan fiduciary. Furthermore, they maintain that any losses the trust attributed to alleged misrepresentations may have been influenced more by fluctuations in the local real estate market and the trust’s own investment strategies than by any statements attributable to Rivera.
