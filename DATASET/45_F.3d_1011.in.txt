You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On June 25, 1991, an alleged robbery and double homicide took place in Bayfield, Kentucky. Patricia Miller, who was then sixteen years old, was arrested the following month along with two other individuals. The next day, a proceeding occurred in the juvenile session of the district court in Lakeshore County, where Patricia Miller was charged at that time only with complicity to commit first-degree robbery, even though the government’s attorney had knowledge of the homicide allegations.

 At the initial hearing, Patricia Miller received appointed counsel, heard an explanation of her rights, and responded to the district court’s question about whether she admitted or denied the offenses. The district court scheduled a later date for disposition and ordered a predisposition report. Between the time of this initial hearing and the next scheduled hearing, the government’s attorney formally added homicide charges against Patricia Miller and sought to transfer her case to adult court.

 At a subsequent hearing in the district court, Patricia Miller’s counsel emphasized that the earlier proceeding constituted an adjudication, arguing that jeopardy had attached and that an adult prosecution would violate double jeopardy principles. The government’s attorney maintained that the earlier proceeding was only a detention hearing, contending that it did not amount to a final adjudication and that there had been no acceptance of any guilty plea. The district court then conducted a hearing on whether Patricia Miller’s case should be handled in adult court. Later, Patricia Miller pursued further review in the circuit court and higher state courts, raising the same double jeopardy concerns.

 In support of its position, the Commonwealth of Kentucky cites Breed v. Jones and emphasizes that juvenile hearings are bifurcated under K.R.S. § 610.080. The Commonwealth of Kentucky argues that no genuine adjudication can occur without a formal acceptance of guilt or a properly conducted adjudicatory phase. It further invokes K.R.S. § 635.020(2) to assert that only before any true adjudication takes place must the government move to transfer the juvenile to adult court. The Commonwealth of Kentucky contends that, in the absence of a Boykin v. Alabama colloquy, any admission during the first session is insufficient to constitute an accepted plea. Relying on Allen v. Walter, it maintains that a judge’s official entry of an order accepting a plea is indispensable, and that setting a date for disposition, without more, does not prove a completed adjudication. Thus, the Commonwealth of Kentucky insists that there was no final determination of guilt, only probable cause for further detention.

 In support of her position, Patricia Miller asserts that the district court’s statements during the first session, including scheduling a disposition hearing and ordering a predisposition report, show that the proceeding functioned as a conclusion of guilt or innocence. She contends that, as in many juvenile courts, if a judge announces that the process is moving directly to disposition, it signifies that there has already been an adjudication. She points out that a juvenile defendant has a right under Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure 8.08 to plead guilty outright, making formal prosecutorial assent unnecessary if the plea is unconditional. She also cites the logic of Boykin v. Alabama to argue that those constitutional protections guard the child-defendant rather than the state, and therefore the government should not be able to nullify her admission. Accordingly, from this perspective, Patricia Miller asserts that the earlier proceeding did, in fact, amount to a final adjudication under the law.
