You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Casey Green and Taylor White worked for X.Y. Enterprises, Inc., a small business run by Alex Brown and Jordan Smith. Green began work in a telemarketing role and advanced quickly to telemarketing manager, while White initially handled telemarketing calls, later moving into order entry and accounting. Both received generally favorable reviews before they started a romantic relationship. According to the company, that relationship affected their work performance. Green was demoted from manager to a regular telemarketer, and shortly afterward, he and White were called into a meeting regarding suspected reports to government agencies responsible for workplace conditions and wage enforcement. Despite their denials, the company insisted they or one of them had contacted the authorities, and at the end of that meeting, both employees were dismissed.

 Green and White alleged they were fired because the company believed they had reported, or were about to report, potential violations of federal wage and safety regulations. They claimed this amounted to wrongful termination under federal law governing overtime and workplace protections. They also argued that the employer’s mistake should not stop them from seeking relief, even though they never actually contacted any government agency.

 Green and White further asserted that their firings violated a recognized public policy exception under Missouri law, which sometimes protects employees who are terminated for reasons that conflict with important legal or governmental interests. The company responded by pointing to Green’s and White’s alleged work-related shortcomings and by denying that any protected conduct really occurred. Green and White, however, contended that the essence of the dispute was tied to the employer’s belief—mistaken or not—that they had engaged in conduct protected by law.

 In support of Green and White, some arguments emphasize that the federal law’s anti-retaliation provision exists to encourage employees to speak up about violations without fear of reprisal. Their position is that the spirit of the law should safeguard workers so that employers cannot stifle complaints simply by firing someone based on a suspicion. This view cites established precedents reading the federal statute broadly to protect conduct that is connected—directly or indirectly—to asserting workplace rights. Additionally, they point to Missouri’s public policy exception for at-will employees, maintaining that state law recognizes situations where workers must be free to cooperate with or contact governmental agencies regarding labor standards. According to these arguments, disputing the employer’s belief or motive should be left to a jury, and the protections of the statute and public policy should not be watered down by requiring an actual report to have been filed.

 In contrast, the company and its leadership argue that Green and White are not covered by federal law because they never actually lodged any complaints. The relevant statute speaks of employees who have filed complaints or taken similar steps, and, according to this view, an employer’s mistake alone should not create a cause of action. They emphasize that nothing in the text explicitly protects employees suspected—wrongly—of making a report. They also contend that extending the statute in this way goes beyond its intended scope and undermines the proper balance between protecting workers’ rights and respecting the employer’s right to terminate employees for legitimate business reasons. Furthermore, the company points to what it describes as a legitimate basis for firing Green and White unrelated to any supposed report, including issues with productivity or work performance. They assert that this more than justifies the dismissals and that any suspicion about government reporting is beside the point when there are valid, documented reasons to end someone’s employment.
