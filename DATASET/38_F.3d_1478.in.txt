You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jason Carter, incarcerated in Alaska, became embroiled in a lengthy conflict with Green Telephone Cooperative over the interruption of telephone services to his small business in Coldvale. Carter contended that the lack of phone service caused the collapse of his enterprise, and attempts to resolve the dispute outside of court proved unsuccessful.

 Seeking relief, Carter filed a civil lawsuit in the superior court in Bayview. Shortly after Green Telephone Cooperative responded in court, Carter confronted Magistrate Linda Moore in Coldvale, insisting on an immediate trial date. Magistrate Moore advised Carter that scheduling a trial was a more involved process handled in Bayview. Carter reacted with anger, shouted at her, and left the courthouse. Months later, the company’s counsel moved for summary judgment against Carter, mailed him a copy of the motion, and he allegedly wrote a letter to Judge Steven Lang threatening harm to certain individuals if he did not receive a fair jury trial. Local law enforcement in Coldvale eventually interviewed Carter; he acknowledged that his letter threatened specific people and stated he hoped for an arrest so he could advance his claims against the cooperative.

 No immediate arrest was made. Eventually, the superior court ruled against Carter on the civil matter, and he learned of the decision while he was out of state. Returning to Coldvale, he traveled to Bayview for medical treatment, and upon discharge, he continued to take prescribed medication. Soon afterward, Carter entered the Coldvale courthouse armed with a loaded gun, confronted Magistrate Moore, and demanded a trial. He held her at gunpoint for a short interval, refused her attempt to call security, and insisted that court officials arrange for a jury trial. After a brief standoff, he let Magistrate Moore leave, and police then apprehended him. The State of Alaska charged Carter with several offenses, including interference with official proceedings under AS 11.56.510(a)(1)(D) based on his threatening letter.

 In support of its position, the State of Alaska maintains that threats of harm aimed at the outcome of court actions fall outside any First Amendment protection and that statutes prohibiting such threats legitimately ensure the integrity of official proceedings. Relying on prominent cases (such as Watts v. United States) and the emphasized prohibition of “true threats,” the State argues that, by focusing on statements a reasonable person would interpret as a serious expression of intent to inflict harm, the law orients itself toward unprotected conduct rather than protected speech. The State further invokes the principle that threats of violence or intimidation in the context of official proceedings need not involve proof of an actual intent or capacity to carry them out; rather, the communicated menace and its potential to disrupt court processes suffices. According to the State’s reading of statutes like AS 11.56.510(a)(1)(D) and related definitions in AS 11.81.900(b)(55), this framework is rationally connected to preventing undue pressure, intimidation, and fear directed at officials or participants in a judicial matter.

 Jason Carter, in contesting the charge, argues that the breadth of the statutory framework extends to a wide range of speech and impermissibly captures expressions protected under the First Amendment. Drawing on cases like Wurtz v. Risley, Carter contends that language in the statute referencing “threatening to commit any crime” or other forms of harm can apply to trivial or completely lawful activities. Carter insists that the statute’s scope necessarily encompasses communications that might simply be heated or forceful efforts to influence a case’s proceedings, which, if criminalized, would chill permissible advocacy and spirited debate. Carter also notes the risk that statements about exposing misconduct or invoking further legal process during litigation could be misconstrued as threats under the statute’s inclusive definitions. As such, Carter maintains that the law sweeps too broadly, punishing those who resort to vehement, yet lawful methods of pressing their claims or protesting perceived injustice, and that a narrower construction is necessary to avoid infringing on core constitutional rights.
