You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Ms. Harrison lived with her children in a house located in Brighton, Maryland. At one point, Ms. Harrison had a past relationship with an individual, Mr. Bennett, who had a history of threatening and violent behavior toward her and her family. One evening, Ms. Harrison was called away from her job because of concerns that Mr. Bennett had broken into her house and was threatening harm. When she arrived, Mr. Bennett physically attacked her, made threats to kill her and her children, and had to be restrained by a neighbor, Mr. Morgan.

 Officer Carter, working for the Brighton, Maryland Police Department, arrived soon after and arrested Mr. Bennett. Ms. Harrison shared with Officer Carter her fear that Mr. Bennett might attempt further violence, noting that Mr. Bennett had previously been convicted of attempting to set her house on fire. Officer Carter allegedly reassured Ms. Harrison that Mr. Bennett would remain in custody overnight and that it was safe for her to return to her workplace, so she left her children at home and went back to work.

 Officer Carter took Mr. Bennett before Commissioner Lopez. Instead of charging him with all available offenses, including assault and breaking and entering, only minor charges such as trespassing and property destruction were pursued. Consequently, Mr. Bennett was released shortly afterward on his own recognizance. According to the allegations, Mr. Bennett then returned to Ms. Harrison’s residence, set fire to the home, and caused the death of her three children who were still inside. Ms. Harrison brought a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming Officer Carter and the Commissioners of Brighton. Officer Carter raised the defense of qualified immunity, denying any constitutional violation.

 In support of Ms. Harrison, legal arguments highlight that an officer’s assurances could create a specific duty to protect when the state, through its agents, places or leaves individuals in heightened peril. These arguments rely on interpretations of DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, suggesting that while there is generally no constitutional obligation to protect citizens from private violence, an affirmative duty may arise if the state’s own actions increase a person’s vulnerability. Advocates emphasize that charging Mr. Bennett solely with minor crimes and releasing him, despite knowledge of his violent threats, contributed to the tragic outcome. They cite various appellate court decisions that interpret DeShaney to allow claims when the government allegedly created or worsened the danger faced by an individual.

 In support of Officer Carter, legal arguments focus on the principle that, under long-established doctrine, public officials are typically shielded from liability for violent acts committed by private individuals. These arguments again cite DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services for the proposition that the Constitution does not impose a general duty to protect citizens from third-party conduct. Officer Carter’s proponents argue that any assurances made or charges filed did not create the required “custodial” or other special status that would trigger a constitutional duty. They assert that qualified immunity permits wide latitude for law enforcement judgments, particularly given the unsettled nature of the contours defining when state officials become liable for private harm under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
