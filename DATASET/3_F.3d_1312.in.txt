You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Two individuals, Alice Road (the driver) and Bob King (the passenger), were traveling north in a small hatchback loaded with bags and boxes in its rear compartment. As they approached an immigration checkpoint well inside the state, a Border Patrol agent, Agent West, directed the vehicle to a secondary inspection area. Alice Road opened the hatchback so the agent could confirm that no additional passengers were concealed. During this process, Agent West or a fellow Border Patrol agent, Agent Green, detected an odor that the agent believed to be associated with methamphetamine emanating from the car. After the initial immigration inquiry ended, the agents asked for and received permission from Alice Road to continue looking inside the vehicle.

 During the extended search of the hatchback’s interior, the agents discovered vitamin powder sometimes used to dilute narcotics, a cigarette pack with marijuana cigarettes, additional small amounts of marijuana, and thousands of dollars in cash scattered in different locations. Agent Green then asked Bob King to empty his pockets, and upon patting him down, found a large quantity of methamphetamine concealed under his clothing. Law enforcement personnel at the checkpoint seized drug paraphernalia from the car, including a small electronic scale in Alice Road’s purse. Both individuals were charged under federal drug statutes.

 One party argued that the immigration checkpoint was structured and trained in a way that might exceed the narrow purpose for which internal checkpoints operate. This party raised concerns about extensive training agents received on recognizing illicit drugs and indicated the agents quickly wrapped up the immigration check and focused on a drug investigation. The questioning included whether open-ended checkpoint procedures could expand into a more general law enforcement hunt, contradicting precedent governing administrative inspections. There were also discussions about the scope of consent given, references to prior drug-related activity, and how much weight those past incidents could carry in the present case.

 The strongest legal arguments for Alice Road winning include the proposition that internal checkpoints have long been upheld for immigration enforcement under United States v. Martinez-Fuerte and other similar cases, and thus do not require an agent to have individual suspicion for referring vehicles to secondary inspection. From that perspective, once the Border Patrol detected the odor of contraband, they were empowered to ask for consent and search for illicit substances, consistent with decisions such as United States v. Barnett and United States v. Preciado-Robles, which confirm that a smell associated with drugs supports further investigation. Under this line of reasoning, any evidence from prior arrests can be admitted if it reliably shows a pattern relevant to the charged offenses, an approach sanctioned by authorities such as United States v. Hill, so long as the district court finds the probative value outweighs the prejudice. Proponents of this viewpoint also underscore that if the driver voluntarily gave permission to search, the agents’ conduct would conform to well-established Fourth Amendment standards allowing consensual inspections.

 The strongest legal arguments for Bob King winning rest on the assertion that the checkpoint search exceeded the permissible scope of an administrative inspection. Relying on principles drawn from cases like United States v. $124,570 U.S. Currency (Campbell), the argument emphasizes that if the agents were using the immigration stop merely as a pretext to investigate drug offenses, then the ordinarily permissible referral to secondary could violate Fourth Amendment safeguards. Those who adopt this view argue that the rapid shift away from any meaningful immigration questioning toward a detailed drug search shows the Border Patrol was effectively conducting a general law enforcement operation. They also contend that there was insufficient probable cause or particularized suspicion to justify searching Bob King’s person, and any narcotics training or incentives might have encouraged more intrusive searches than what might be needed solely for checking immigration status. Under this theory, once the immigration purpose ended, continued detention and investigation for non-immigration reasons required a higher threshold of suspicion than existed at the time.
