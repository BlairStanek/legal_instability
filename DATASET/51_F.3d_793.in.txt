You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Cameron Browne was formerly employed as a police officer by Riverton. He is Black and was accused by a coworker, Taylor Reyes, of making flirtatious remarks and implying she had “a place to go” if her husband ever grew tired of her. After Ms. Reyes’s spouse complained about these interactions, a superior officer—Captain Miller—arranged for Ms. Reyes to record a private conversation with Mr. Browne without his knowledge.

 Upon hearing the recording, Mr. Browne’s supervisors decided that while Mr. Browne’s statements did not rise to the level of sexual harassment, he must be counseled for having inappropriate conversations. During his counseling, Captain Miller and Lieutenant Powell confronted Mr. Browne about whether he had made certain remarks. Mr. Browne denied them. Captain Miller then recommended that Mr. Browne be discharged for dishonesty. Chief Edwards reviewed the recommendation and carried out further investigation. Ultimately, Mr. Browne resigned just before the recommended termination would have taken effect.

 During the same period, Mr. Browne alleged that Riverton’s actions were motivated by racial discrimination, asserting that white officers discovered lying were treated more favorably. He also introduced evidence purporting to show that other misconduct complaints against certain white officers did not result in covert surveillance. After Mr. Browne filed suit, Chief Edwards gave a statement to a local publication indicating that Mr. Browne had essentially faced termination for dishonesty and that race had not played a role in the decision. Mr. Browne then amended his claims to include defamation based on these comments.

 In urging that Mr. Browne should prevail, several core arguments appear. First, it is argued that hidden electronic monitoring violated Mr. Browne’s right to privacy under California Penal Code § 632, because any exceptions for law enforcement do not extend to the recording of an internal personnel discussion outside traditional criminal investigations. Second, Mr. Browne contends that no applicable immunity under California Government Code §§ 815.2 or 820.2 should shield Riverton for what he views as operational acts rather than discretionary policy actions. Third, he asserts that he was defamed because statements labeling him dishonest were factually untrue, causing material harm to his reputation. Fourth, in responding to any suggestion that the alleged misconduct was legitimate grounds for dismissal, Mr. Browne advocates that the reasons given by Riverton were pretextual and racially motivated, violating Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

 In favor of Riverton, several counterarguments appear. First, Riverton points to California Penal Code § 633, insisting that authorized police officers remain exempt from civil or criminal liability for recording a communication if that practice was permissible before the relevant statute was enacted, on the theory that the officers were acting within their scope of authority. Second, Riverton invokes California Government Code §§ 815.2 and 820.2, claiming that the decisions of its officers about how to investigate and discipline employees are covered as discretionary acts, which bars claims arising therefrom. Third, as to the defamation claim, Riverton maintains that everything stated was either true or reasonably supported—particularly since Mr. Browne had denied remarks preserved on a recording. Fourth, regarding any allegations of racism, Riverton contends that Mr. Browne’s termination (or intended termination) was solely based on dishonesty, and it notes that consistent enforcement of honesty policies does not reflect discrimination under Title VII or 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
