You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Daniel Brown traveled on Carrier 1 Flight #123 from City A, California, to City B in Ohio, planning to connect onward to City C. He was one of the last passengers to leave the plane, wore a dark sweatsuit and jewelry, and carried no baggage on board. A gate agent for Carrier 1 indicated that Daniel Brown purchased his ticket in cash shortly before the flight. An officer—observing his luggage tag, the timing of the ticket purchase, and the name discrepancy between the ticket and Daniel Brown’s identification—took interest in him. The officer asked Daniel Brown a series of questions, and he answered that he was returning from visiting family.

 Daniel Brown chose not to board his connecting flight to City C, going instead downstairs to the main ticket counter of Carrier 1. Shortly afterward, he left the terminal and got into a taxi. Officers stopped the taxi, questioned Daniel Brown, and obtained consent to search his person, discovering a sum of cash. They asked why he was leaving without his suitcase, and he replied that he intended to retrieve it later. The taxi driver told an officer that Daniel Brown asked to be driven to a bus station for travel to City E, even though Daniel Brown mentioned to an officer that he had plans in City B to visit a friend (but could not give an address).

 A short while later, Daniel Brown’s airline ticket turned up behind the taxi’s rear seat cushion. Asked again about searching his suitcase, Daniel Brown refused to consent. Following Daniel Brown’s departure, an officer retrieved his suitcase from Carrier 1. Hours passed, and a judicial officer eventually issued a warrant for the bag. The officers searched the suitcase pursuant to that warrant and reported discovering contraband. Daniel Brown was taken into custody when he attempted to claim his luggage at an airport.

 Those advocating for the Government emphasize that carrying out a warranted search of property suspected to hold contraband is permissible under the Fourth Amendment when certain facts reliably support a conclusion that the property contains illegal items. They point to the possibility that the purchase of a ticket in cash at the last minute, the inconsistent explanations for travel, and apparent efforts to distance oneself from a bag strengthen the inference of probable cause. Citing cases such as United States v. Place and Florida v. Royer, they argue that airport agents may seize suspicious luggage for a reasonable time, provided there is a sufficiently strong basis—potentially reaching probable cause—to believe the suitcase contains narcotics. Under this view, the seemingly contradictory statements, last-minute change of flight plans, and sudden departure from the airport justify intervening to secure the bag. Referring to the principle that, when an officer accumulates enough facts, a neutral judicial officer can be sought for a search warrant, they emphasize that a lawful seizure is consistent with precedents like United States v. Chadwick, Arkansas v. Sanders, and Illinois v. Gates.

 Those advocating for Daniel Brown rely on the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that a warrant is typically needed in advance of a seizure unless limited exceptions apply. They draw support from cases such as Terry v. Ohio, which allows only brief investigative detentions, arguing that taking a bag for many hours without a warrant, and without demonstrating urgent need, sidelines the traditional warrant requirement. They invoke United States v. Place for the contention that even with reasonable suspicion, an excessively long detention of property crosses constitutional boundaries. They also underscore that probable cause alone might not suffice for a warrantless seizure in the absence of exigent circumstances or another recognized exception to the warrant rule. Arguing that no demonstrated urgency existed, they highlight how officers could have arranged other investigative measures without detaining the suitcase for an extended time.
