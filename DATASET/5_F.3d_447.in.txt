You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Members of the Carter Class are individuals who had recently regained eligibility for certain benefits. One representative individual, Andrew Carter, had been released from detention and received a one-time “gate release” payment, along with in-kind support in the form of food and shelter. When Andrew Carter sought his benefit after being discharged, the sum he had received as a onetime payment was deducted from his first three months of benefits. The Carter Class brought a complaint against the Secretary, contending that this practice clashed with certain statutory requirements governing monthly benefit calculations.

 According to the facts presented, beneficiaries under the relevant program generally have their monthly benefit amounts offset by other income. Under a system of Retrospective Monthly Accounting (RMA), the benefit in a given month is calculated based on the income received in the second month prior. However, there is an exception for the first month of benefit eligibility (and possibly the second month if the Secretary chooses) where the calculation looks instead at the actual income and relevant circumstances in that first (and possibly second) month. The Carter Class argues that the Secretary’s approach, which effectively used the same onetime payment to reduce benefits in several successive months, created an unfair triple-deduction scenario.

 The Secretary’s policies, which appear in detailed agency guidance, specify that for someone who becomes eligible again after a period of ineligibility, the “transitional computation cycle” applies to the first two months. By the third month, the system reverts to the standard two-month look-back. Under these rules, the onetime payment received by Andrew Carter was treated as income that applied to the first month (on a prospective basis) and continued to have an impact into subsequent months. This caused the Carter Class to contend that the nonrecurring character of their initial income was not treated as a “relevant circumstance” in those calculations.

 In support of the Carter Class’s position, it is argued that the statutory language instructing that the benefit for the first (and optionally second) month be computed based on “income … and other relevant circumstances” must be read to include the nonrecurring nature of the payment. They rely on 42 U.S.C. § 1382(c)(2)(A) for that requirement and emphasize that this section was designed to avoid hardship by preventing prior or singular resources from unduly reducing a beneficiary’s payments in the initial months. The Carter Class contends that similar statutory provisions, such as 42 U.S.C. § 1382(c)(5), illustrate that certain one-time payments should be counted only once. This is interpreted to reflect a broader principle within the law that nonrecurring income in the first month of eligibility should never be used to lower benefits multiple times, so as to maintain a basic level of subsistence and avert disproportionate penalties on new or returning beneficiaries.

 On the other side, the Secretary maintains that the overall statutory design and the Retrospective Monthly Accounting system permit the counting of the onetime payment across multiple months for ease of administration and to guard against overpayments. The Secretary notes that RMA is meant to bring predictability and correctness to benefit calculations by looking back at actual income, and that Congress specifically enumerated certain categories of income in 42 U.S.C. § 1382(c)(5) that must be counted only once. According to the Secretary, the fact that Congress singled out specific types of payments for one-month-only deductions suggests that other onetime income can legitimately be reflected in more than one month’s calculation. Such an approach, the Secretary asserts, is in keeping with a goal of preventing waste, fraud, and miscalculations, while still allowing the prospectively based provision to operate for the first and possibly second month without excluding this particular type of payment from the multi-month offset.
