You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Zachary Lloyd, an employee of Redwood Inc., sustained injuries on a site located in Massachusetts. That site contained a sulphur pit constructed many years earlier by Redwood Builders, a wholly owned subsidiary of Redwood Inc. Lloyd and his family pursued legal claims against both Redwood Builders and Redwood Inc. under theories of negligence.

 Redwood Builders was covered by a general liability insurance policy issued by Pegasus Insurance Co., which also listed Redwood Inc. as an insured. In addition, an umbrella insurance arrangement provided extra indemnification through Brighton Ins. Co. Whether the loss relating to Lloyd’s injuries was a “completed operations hazard” loss or a “general liability” loss proved to be pivotal because the policy placed an annual aggregate limit on completed operations hazard losses, while general liability losses were subject only to a per-occurrence limit without an aggregate cap.

 The policy’s language defined a completed operations hazard as arising from operations that had been finished or abandoned, provided the resulting injury occurred away from the premises owned or rented by the named insured. Another part of the policy contained a severability clause stating that insurance under the policy applied separately to each insured. One side of the dispute emphasized the unity of Redwood Inc. and Redwood Builders as a single named insured for purposes of premises ownership, while the other side stressed the severability clause as ensuring separate policy treatment for each. At stake was whether the accident site was considered the property of the relevant insured entity or, alternatively, whether it was away from that entity’s premises under the policy language.

 Arguments supporting Redwood Builders’ position that the loss qualifies as a completed operations hazard center on interpreting the policy’s severability clause to treat each insured as though it stands alone. Proponents of this approach contend that it is consistent with established principles—illustrated by references to treatises such as 13 John Alan Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice—that severability clauses ensure coverage limitations and exceptions should be evaluated separately for each insured. Citing cases like United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Globe Indemnity Co. and American Nat’l Fire Ins. Co. v. Estate of Fournelle, they assert that because Redwood Builders’ operations were completed and the pit was constructed long before the injury, the incident fits the traditional notion of completed operations coverage. They maintain that any references in the policy to the named insured owning the premises should be construed only with respect to Redwood Builders’ own property, not Redwood Inc.’s, and that this reading is consistent with accepted practice in commercial insurance policies where businesses seek extra protection for work completed and relinquished to another entity.

 Arguments supporting Brighton Ins. Co.’s position that the loss constitutes general liability focus on the policy’s reference to injury taking place on property of the “named insured,” which, under their interpretation, is a single unified entity comprising Redwood Inc. and Redwood Builders collectively. Proponents of this reading highlight that the per-occurrence limits apply equally to all insureds, and that the policy’s own text, especially when read in context, describes Redwood Inc. and its subsidiaries as one overarching named insured for premises-based determinations. They point to authority suggesting that coordination of multiple corporate entities as a single ownership group can mean that property used by one subsidiary is effectively the property of the collective entity. They also stress that the severability clause, by its terms, does not affect the overarching limits or the characterization of the premises, reflecting that it does not expand or redefine the underlying scope of hazards covered but simply ensures each insured is protected up to the policy’s overall limits.
