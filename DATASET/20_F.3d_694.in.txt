You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Everley was charged with two counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud. The government’s case highlighted transactions where Everley allegedly assisted another individual in executing fraudulent wire communications. Everley defended against these allegations by challenging various evidentiary and sentencing-related decisions.

 During pretrial proceedings, Everley sought to keep the government from introducing evidence that she had been convicted in Tennessee of several misdemeanor offenses related to issuing checks without sufficient funds. Everley argued that the earlier convictions were unrelated to her credibility and should not be considered during her trial. The government asserted that the convictions were relevant to Everley’s honesty.

 After conviction on the wire fraud charges, Everley also argued that she should receive a reduction in her offense level on the grounds that she was a minimal or minor participant during the fraudulent transactions. The government countered that Everley’s role warranted no reduction, noting her involvement in the underlying scheme. The dispute centered on how significantly Everley’s actions affected the fraudulent conduct.

 In support of Everley’s position, arguments focused on the possibility that convictions under the Tennessee worthless check statute did not necessarily prove intent to deceive or false statement, as the statute covers knowing conduct but not always fraudulent conduct. Advocates for Everley stressed that the mere act of writing checks while lacking funds might not, by itself, reveal a character of dishonesty. They cited the Tennessee worthless check statute—which sometimes penalizes those who act only with knowledge of insufficient funds—and pointed to case law suggesting that bad check offenses can arise from a variety of situations, not intrinsically linked to deceit. Everley’s position emphasized that, without more details about the specific circumstances of writing those checks, the convictions did not automatically call her credibility into question. Regarding sentencing, Everley’s side argued that her part in the alleged fraud was overshadowed by others' more significant actions, and that she did not substantially influence the operation or scope of the scheme.

 The government’s arguments centered on the notion that issuing worthless checks has long been tied to fraudulent intent under Tennessee law. They pointed to interpretations of the statute suggesting that writing checks known to be unsupported by sufficient funds carries an implied misrepresentation. Case law was cited for the premise that fraudulent intent is a key element of criminal liability in worthless check offenses, underlining that a person writing such checks must know or intend to defraud the recipient or the bank. By that reasoning, the government maintained that these convictions indicate a pattern of dishonest dealings relevant to Everley’s credibility. Concerning Everley’s level of participation in the charged wire fraud, the government maintained that regardless of whether Everley was the main actor, she knowingly contributed to the overall scheme and should remain accountable at a level consistent with someone who played a more substantial role.
