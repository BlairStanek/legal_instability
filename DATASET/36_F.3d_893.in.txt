You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Anadromous fish, including Chinook salmon and steelhead trout, rely on certain waterways for their spawning habitat. Some of these fish spawn in tributaries of the Timber River, and one such tributary is Foster Creek, a non-navigable stream. In the mid-1950s, Gus W. Agerson constructed a small hydroelectric installation on Foster Creek adjacent to his property. This installation uses a low dam—approximately three feet in height—to generate a modest supply of power solely consumed on his own ranch buildings. As a consequence, the dam blocks fish from migrating to the upstream portions of Foster Creek. Over time, various organizations and government departments have expressed concern that this upstream blockage reduces the available spawning grounds for fish that are a source of commercial, recreational, and tribal fishing interests across multiple states and beyond.

 Under the Federal Power Act, certain hydroelectric projects may require licensing if they affect interstate or foreign commerce. In 1985, seeking clarity on whether he needed such a license for his existing setup, Agerson submitted a declaration of intention to continue operating his hydroelectric project. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission evaluated several factors: whether the project occupied public lands, whether it used surplus water from a federally owned dam, whether any generated power was transmitted across state boundaries, and whether the project connected to an interstate power grid. Concluding none of these elements were present, the Commission initially determined no license was needed.

 Thereafter, the Department of Commerce, the Nez Perce Tribe, the National Animal Organization, and the Gem Wildlife Organization argued that an additional factor—the project’s potential effect on fish migrating among multiple states and countries—should propel the project into federal licensing jurisdiction. They emphasized that anadromous fish from the Franklin River Basin and the Timber River travel across state lines or into foreign waters, thereby connecting this small tributary dam to broader commercial and ecological interests. They also pointed to evidence suggesting that even a modest dam can diminish spawning habitat and reduce fish populations, potentially impacting commercial, recreational, and tribal fisheries.

 In support of requiring a license, legal arguments focused on the broad scope of the Federal Power Act. First, it was contended that the Act’s language covered all impacts on interstate and foreign commerce, not merely those related to navigation or interstate power transmission. Second, reliance was placed on cases interpreting similar federal statutes as invoking the full reach of federal authority under the Commerce Clause. Proponents of licensing underscored the Act’s goal: comprehensive development and oversight of water resources when such development meaningfully intersects with commerce. By pointing to fish populations that cross state lines or enter foreign waters, they argued the project’s obstruction of spawning habitat has genuine implications for commercial fisheries and tribal interests, thus giving the Commission licensing authority. They also asserted that precedent has treated the term “commerce” broadly, maintaining that the Act does not confine licensing jurisdiction to navigable waterways or multi-state power grids.

 Those advocating that no license was required offered a narrower reading of the Federal Power Act. They noted that historically, regulation under that statute has turned on impacts to navigability or the interstate flow of electrical power. In their view, the project at issue neither changes the navigable capacity of any river nor supplies electricity beyond the boundaries of a single private property. They also pointed out that the Commission’s role was principally to supervise hydroelectric power generation for interstate consumption, not to address every potential environmental or fish-related concern. In advancing this position, they relied on the text of the Act, emphasizing that it sets forth specific conditions—like occupying federal lands or transmitting power across state lines—to trigger licensing. Finally, they maintained that small, localized dams with minimal electricity output fall outside Congress’s intent for broad federal oversight and that adopting an all-encompassing view of “commerce” would expand the Commission’s jurisdiction far beyond its intended scope.
