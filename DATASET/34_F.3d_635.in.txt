You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Leslie confessed to taking another individual’s life in 1977 and was sentenced to death in 1978. Over many years, Leslie pursued legal avenues challenging aspects of this conviction and sentence. After various court proceedings concluded, Leslie submitted an application to the Board of Pardons asking that his death sentence be commuted to life. The Board of Pardons, by law, included the Governor, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, and it scheduled a hearing to consider Leslie’s request.

 At the clemency hearing, which was conducted in a relatively informal setting, Leslie’s defense counsel presented arguments supporting commutation, and multiple people, including representatives of the Attorney General’s office, spoke against granting Leslie’s request. Leslie had raised concerns about the Attorney General’s participation on the Board, given the Attorney General had previously played a role in prosecuting him. Leslie also objected to the presence of two assistant attorneys general who argued against his commutation, although his counsel later withdrew one aspect of this objection. Leslie continued to claim the composition of the Board and the Attorney General’s role compromised fairness.

 Leslie further argued that he was treated differently from other individuals seeking commutation, asserting that in his case, the Board of Pardons did not request a recommendation from the Board of Parole. He presented evidence intended to show that similarly situated applicants had at times benefited from more investigation or formal recommendations. The Board of Pardons, for its part, received an investigative report from the Board of Parole but did not solicit a specific recommendation regarding Leslie. Leslie argued that the Board’s approach resulted in an inconsistent application of its own procedures.

 In support of its position, the Board of Pardons relied on the principle that states have broad discretion over clemency proceedings, citing precedents indicating that such decisions are typically matters of grace rather than of right. It contended that no specific statutory standards constrained its discretion; thus, no protected liberty interest arose from the chance to request commutation. The Board of Pardons pointed out that multiple courts have concluded clemency procedures are discretionary and that the Due Process Clause does not obligate states to adhere to particular frameworks when deciding whether to commute lawfully imposed sentences. The Board of Pardons further maintained that its request for an investigation from the Board of Parole was consistent with its practice in death sentence cases, emphasizing that no established requirements mandated further action or a recommendation from the Board of Parole. It asserted that whether members of the Attorney General’s staff argued against commutation did not create a constitutional violation, in light of the wide discretion such boards are afforded and the absence of any promise of a particular result.

 In support of Leslie’s position, it was argued that clemency serves as an essential safeguard — often called a “fail safe” — in the capital sentencing process and that its importance is recognized by the highest courts. Leslie maintained that this safeguard is undermined if the state’s chief prosecuting official, who sought and defended a capital conviction on appeal, also serves as one of the final decisionmakers. He insisted this inherently compromises neutrality, asserting that any arrangement making it highly likely that the Attorney General would reject a request for mercy violates basic concepts of fairness under the Due Process Clause. Leslie further claimed there was no legitimate basis for the Board of Pardons to block or discourage the Board of Parole from making a substantive recommendation, contending that this omission led to unequal and arbitrary treatment when comparing his case to non-capital commutation applicants who had previously been subject to full investigative and recommendation procedures.
