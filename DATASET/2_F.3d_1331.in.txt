You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Maiella Corp. (previously known under a different corporate name) once operated a wood treatment plant on approximately forty-five acres near the Redwood River in Riverborough, South Carolina. For nearly four decades, wood preservatives were applied through a process that generated sludge by-products, which were disposed of by burying them in a marsh area. Kelevan Yards, Inc., seeking to establish a shipyard, acquired this property in the late 1970s.

 Years later, Kelevan Yards, Inc. discovered underground creosote during site work for a Navy contract. Subsequently, Kelevan Yards, Inc. filed a lawsuit in federal court against Maiella Corp., claiming both negligence under state law and relief under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The parties in the case agreed to separate (bifurcate) Kelevan Yards, Inc.’s state law claims (involving the sums allegedly spent on and lost in certain parcels of land) from the pending CERCLA issues, which focused on who would bear responsibility for any environmental cleanup.

 During the jury trial on the state law claims, Kelevan Yards, Inc. put forward evidence contending that, at the time of the property sale, Maiella Corp. did not disclose the presence of hazardous materials on the site. Maiella Corp. countered that its past disposal practices were not expressly concealed and that state law damages did not encompass any subsequent cleanup obligations, which it argued would be handled exclusively through CERCLA proceedings. Meanwhile, the question arose as to whether Kelevan Yards, Inc. should be permitted to recover damages for lost property value in a scenario where a future remediation could restore some or all of that value.

 Maiella Corp. asserts that the claims of alleged negligent nondisclosure and any resulting damages under state law were properly confined to whatever the property was worth at the time of sale, excluding any expenses for environmental investigation or cleanup. Maiella Corp. emphasizes that CERCLA is the exclusive avenue for response costs, given Congress’s intent that CERCLA address contamination through specific remedial measures rather than duplicating available judicial remedies under state tort theories. Additionally, Maiella Corp. cites the principle that, under common law, damages for a land sale dispute concern only the difference between the price paid and the actual value as of the transaction date, without regard to subsequent changes in worth. It also insists that allowing any separate award outside of CERCLA’s cost allocation framework would create inconsistency, given CERCLA’s tailored approach to apportioning liability among multiple potentially responsible parties.

 Kelevan Yards, Inc. argues that the state law tort claim independently supports recovering the property’s purchase price and the financial outlays for improvements because the seller’s alleged failure to disclose left the buyer unaware of the land’s compromised condition. Kelevan Yards, Inc. maintains that the law governing negligent nondisclosure entitles a purchaser to obtain the full value of what was lost—the benefit of the bargain—including consequential harm caused by hidden defects. Kelevan Yards, Inc. further contends that this remedy is distinct from any eventual CERCLA-based allocation of response costs, because tort law in South Carolina protects the immediate interests of a buyer who has been misled into paying more than a property was worth. And while a CERCLA cleanup might ultimately affect the land’s future market price, Kelevan Yards, Inc. believes that evaluations under CERCLA do not negate a purchaser’s state law right to be made whole for the hidden deficit in value at the time of sale.
