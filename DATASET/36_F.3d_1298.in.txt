You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Arthur Green was indicted for possession of a personal check alleged to be stolen from the mail, in possible violation of federal statutes. He was apprehended following a visit by a law enforcement officer and a postal inspector to a lodging in Bellview, Texas, where Green was located. Green raised a challenge to the use of both the checkbook and a statement he later made, claiming he had a right to contest the way those were obtained.

 The postal inspector, Joseph Butler, acted on a tip indicating that Green might have stolen mail. Butler enlisted the support of Sgt. William Gray, a local police officer, to accompany him for personal safety reasons and because the lodging was in an area known for drug activity. They discovered that the room in question was registered to Michael Eaton, who had allowed Green to spend the previous night there. Upon entering at Eaton’s invitation, they found Green in the bathroom. During a brief look around, Sgt. Gray shined a flashlight in the trash can and noticed a checkbook. All three individuals in the room were questioned about the checkbook, and they disclaimed any knowledge of it. Eaton eventually provided written consent for a broader search. Green was asked to provide handwriting samples and later followed Butler to the postal inspection office.

 Green asserted that he considered himself under pressure during the encounter, especially after Butler suggested that if Green did not cooperate, local authorities might detain him for additional investigative steps. Green stated that he was offered a choice between heading to the postal inspection office or risking an immediate call to police. He ultimately went to the office, where he was photographed, fingerprinted, and made further statements. He later testified that he had a legitimate interest in the seized check. Eaton and his companion, who were likewise in the lodging room, did not interfere with the officers’ actions. Some viewed the checkbook’s discovery as incident to a permissible inspection of the area; others questioned whether this discovery occurred in a manner that respected Green’s rights, given that there was no arrest warrant or probable cause at that time.

 For Green’s position, one set of arguments relies on precedents concerning privacy and unlawful searches, such as Rakas v. Illinois and Minnesota v. Olson, to claim that an overnight guest in a residence has a protectable privacy interest there. Green emphasizes that no warrant was in hand and points to doctrines holding that consent or any “plain view” rationale must remain strictly limited. He further contends that the absence of exigent circumstances or probable cause required the officers to refrain from retrieving items from containers, particularly if they were not immediately visible as evidence. Green maintains that any statement or handwriting sample obtained shortly after the disputed discovery should be treated as fruit of an unlawful seizure under cases like Wong Sun and Brown v. Illinois, contending that the improper conduct directly influenced his willingness to confess and provide additional evidence.

 For the Government, the principal arguments refer to recognized Fourth Amendment exceptions, suggesting that lawful presence in the lodging and the room occupant’s voluntary invitation created an atmosphere in which the officers could observe items without a warrant. The Government invokes theories of implied or express consent, maintaining that once they were clearly inside with the occupant’s permission, brief inspections, including shining a flashlight into a nearby receptacle, remained within any reasonable scope of that consent. They also point to potential doctrines like plain view, protective sweeps, or inevitable discovery, suggesting that the checkbook’s incriminating nature could have been uncovered through consent-based searching, even had it not been spotted at the outset. The Government contends that any statements by Green were given after a proper advisement of rights, making them a product of free will and validly admissible under cases discussing attenuation of any initial search concerns.
