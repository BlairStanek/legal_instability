You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Ms. Carter, who was in her sixties at the time, visited Dr. Wilson in Cedarville, Mississippi, complaining of abdominal pain. Dr. Wilson’s records reflected that Ms. Carter had a “pelvic-falling out” sensation and an enlarged uterus; Ms. Carter denies ever reporting such a sensation. Dr. Wilson recommended a hysterectomy based on his assessment of fibroid tumors, a uterus twice its normal size, and other complaints. During surgery, Dr. Wilson removed Ms. Carter’s uterus and sent it for pathology testing, which later revealed no fibroid tumors and showed that the uterus was actually smaller than average. After recuperating from the operation, Ms. Carter continued to experience the same discomfort she had reported before surgery.

 Dr. Wilson also advised Ms. Carter’s adult daughter, Ms. Kelly Carter, to undergo a comparable procedure, citing similar justifications about fibroids and chronic pelvic pain. Ms. Kelly Carter later discovered from her pathology report that she had no fibroid tumors either. Ms. Carter became aware of her own pathology findings, and of her daughter’s experiences, only after requesting and reviewing medical records some years later. Ms. Carter says that until she examined those records, she did not realize that Dr. Wilson’s initial accounts of an enlarged uterus and fibroids could be inaccurate.

 Ms. Carter sued Dr. Wilson for medical malpractice, asserting that the hysterectomy was unnecessary. She sought both compensatory and punitive damages. There were debates over when Ms. Carter first discovered, or should have discovered, that her surgery might have been avoidable. On one view, the continuation of her symptoms immediately after the operation suggested that she either knew, or could have learned with reasonable effort, that something was amiss. On another view, Ms. Carter did not suspect misdiagnosis until the medical records in her possession indicated that her uterus was not enlarged and that there were no fibroids. Ms. Carter also attempted to obtain and introduce evidence of other hysterectomies performed by Dr. Wilson, but she faced legal hurdles concerning discovery of those records and whether such evidence would be admissible at trial.

 Supporters of Ms. Carter’s position point to laws and precedent governing the timing of discovery in medical malpractice cases, including Mississippi Code Annotated § 15-1-36(1). According to these arguments, Ms. Carter’s injuries were not apparent until she accessed official paperwork showing that her original condition was not as diagnosed. They argue that mere failure of the procedure to relieve her prior pain could not by itself reveal it was unwarranted; she only knew about the alleged inaccuracy once she saw the medical diagnoses and pathology results, which directly contradicted Dr. Wilson’s stated reasons for surgery. This interpretation leans on decisions emphasizing that a lawsuit’s clock begins when the patient, exercising reasonable diligence, uncovered or should have uncovered not just that a treatment failed, but that it was altogether unjustifiable. In their view, gathering and examining medical documentation was the critical step for Ms. Carter, and without it, she had no knowledge that her surgery was allegedly unnecessary. Advocates for Ms. Carter also contend that details about other surgeries performed by Dr. Wilson might bear on whether there was a consistent pattern or practice, possibly related to punitive damages or fraudulent inducement. They cite rules of evidence that permit introduction of similar acts if relevant to proving intent or motive, asserting that the interests of justice could outweigh concerns about prejudice or privacy if proper procedures were followed.

 Supporters of Dr. Wilson’s position counter that Ms. Carter, by noticing the same unchanged symptoms almost immediately after surgery, should have realized that the treatment was unsuccessful because it was based on a misdiagnosis. They argue that the very fact Ms. Carter’s pain did not improve was enough to encourage her to investigate. Under Mississippi Code Annotated § 15-1-36(1), the standard of reasonable diligence should have prompted her to ask questions, seek other opinions, or acquire medical records well before she actually did. They thus consider the claim time-barred. Further, they rely on rules of evidence such as Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) to assert that alleged wrongs to other patients cannot automatically be used to show wrongdoing in Ms. Carter’s situation, especially if references to unrelated procedures would simply prejudice the fact-finder. Concerning the subpoena Ms. Carter issued for other patient files, they point to physician-patient privilege and privacy protections, emphasizing that the sensitive nature of complete medical histories should not be compromised and accusing Ms. Carter of overreaching in seeking materials not strictly necessary for her own specific claim. They maintain that there were alternative means, such as interrogatories or depositions, to ascertain whether patterns existed without intruding on other individuals’ confidential information.
