You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Smith and Alex Smith were each charged under the Clean Water Act and another federal statute for allegedly handling industrial wastewater and hazardous substances without the required authorization. They filed waivers regarding how they would be formally charged. Eventually, they entered pleas of guilty. By these pleas, they agreed to certain terms about not pursuing an appeal on sentencing matters. Later, they were each sentenced by the district court to terms of imprisonment, fines, and supervised release.

 Before the sentencing, there had been discussions involving both sides and the probation office about the possible penalty ranges under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. When Jordan Smith and Alex Smith learned their actual sentences, they sought to challenge various guideline calculations. One concern was that, at the time they removed certain sampling devices from their plating lines, they did not realize there was a pending investigation. Another concern was whether multiple increases in their offense level amounted to counting the same factor more than once. They also objected to how multiple environmental offenses were grouped.

 Both sides recognized that the plea agreements contained specific language that supposedly gave up the defendants’ right to seek review of the sentences. These agreements spelled out that the ultimate sentences could not be predicted precisely and that, in exchange for certain concessions, Jordan Smith and Alex Smith would waive their right to challenge their sentences. At the same time, there were questions about whether the district court might rely on impermissible considerations or exceed lawful limits. The parties also noted that the government itself could decide whether to invoke the waiver or address the sentencing issues on their merits.

 Arguments favoring the Government’s position on the sentencing included that a defendant’s right to appeal, though set out by statute, can be knowingly and voluntarily relinquished through clear plea agreement language. Several cases were cited as precedent for the principle that the statutory right to appeal may be waived in this context, provided there is an adequate showing that the defendant understood the implications. Such arguments also emphasized that no factor explicitly barred the waiver (for instance, there was no claim the sentences exceeded any legal maximum), and the transcripts showed extensive questioning of the defendants to confirm their understanding and willingness to accept the terms.

 Arguments supporting Jordan Smith and Alex Smith’s position relied on the premise that, even if an agreement contains a waiver provision, the government may still choose to address the merits of the sentencing issues. These arguments stress that an individual’s statutory right to appellate review should not be overridden unless the government insists upon the waiver and demonstrates that the plea discussions explicitly covered its scope and consequences. They also highlight the longstanding practice that courts typically rely on the government to raise the waiver if it intends to enforce it and to help clarify the defendants’ awareness of all rights being waived. The question of whether the waiver applied uniformly to all possible sentencing challenges was raised, suggesting that, if the government does not press the waiver, then the sentencing issues could be fully reviewed.
