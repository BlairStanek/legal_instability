You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A metropolitan sewer district in Townville and Barnett County, Kentucky, embarked on a large waste water treatment project intended to benefit certain surrounding regions. Jackson Browne Company, Inc. and LMN Construction Company, Inc. were hired under a contract to perform substantial portions of the construction work. Generis Testing Company and Maxwell D. Phillips Consulting Engineers, Inc. provided technical services relating to design, management, and soil testing.

 During construction, Jackson Browne Company, Inc. and LMN Construction Company, Inc. retained a subcontractor, Kendrick, Inc., to undertake underground excavation. Kendrick, Inc. encountered unexpected subsurface conditions that the subcontractor attributed to inaccurate or incomplete information in the projectâ€™s engineering plans. As costs escalated, disagreement arose about the responsibility for these overruns. Despite communications indicating concern over the design, it was not until certain formal agreements and a subsequent lawsuit were initiated that possible liabilities became concrete and the question of indemnity came to the forefront.

 Kendrick, Inc. eventually submitted claims related to additional expenses it allegedly incurred. Jackson Browne Company, Inc. and LMN Construction Company, Inc. acknowledged, in a written arrangement with Kendrick, Inc., the underlying cost issues and agreed on a mechanism to pay Kendrick, Inc. only if Jackson Browne Company, Inc. and LMN Construction Company, Inc. obtained recovery from Generis Testing Company and Maxwell D. Phillips Consulting Engineers, Inc. Litigation concerning indemnity, timeliness of asserted claims, and alleged professional shortcomings in design and testing services ensued, bringing into question which statutory period for bringing claims should apply.

 Jackson Browne Company, Inc. and LMN Construction Company, Inc. present several arguments that their formal arrangement with Kendrick, Inc. and subsequent legal action fit squarely within recognized principles governing indemnification. They note that they were not responsible for originating the claimed design inaccuracies and that their liability exposure derived solely from following the engineering directives of Generis Testing Company and Maxwell D. Phillips Consulting Engineers, Inc. They emphasize that someone who merely relies on plans or other directions qualifies for indemnity when obligations arise from an allegedly faulty professional service. They also cite the principle codified in relevant statutes that a good-faith acknowledgment of potential liability should not trigger an impossibly short window to seek indemnity, especially when they contend they were unaware of the full scope of potential damages until formal proceedings began. They further argue that allowing adequate time for indemnity claims helps ensure fairness and comports with established doctrines recognizing that indemnity is designed to shift losses to the party more directly at fault.

 Generis Testing Company and Maxwell D. Phillips Consulting Engineers, Inc. contend they should be protected against stale claims, pointing to provisions in statutory law designed to impose a stringent timeline when professional services are called into question. They maintain that as soon as any party becomes aware of a design-related cost overrun, the law imposes a clear duty to investigate and bring claims within the prescribed timeframe. They support this position by citing precedent that emphasizes the importance of swift notice to professional service providers so they may prepare a proper defense. In their view, Jackson Browne Company, Inc. and LMN Construction Company, Inc. recognized the significance of the design issues and memorialized that recognition in a written agreement before any lawsuit was filed, thus triggering the time limit. By emphasizing the protective reasons behind limiting how long after an event a claim may be brought, Generis Testing Company and Maxwell D. Phillips Consulting Engineers, Inc. maintain that the relevant statutory scheme bars belated indemnity actions and avoids the unfairness of open-ended liability.
