You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Valley Growers Cooperative is a group of agricultural employers in Idaho that filed a lawsuit involving the Department of Labor’s process for approving wage rates and qualifications for hiring foreign workers. Under federal law, agricultural employers may employ foreign workers when there are not enough domestic workers available, provided that domestic workers’ wages and conditions are not adversely affected. Valley Growers Cooperative submitted proposed wage schedules and job qualifications, prompting a review by the Department of Labor.

 Delgado, Silva, and Ramos intervened in that lawsuit, stating concerns about both the wage schedules set by Valley Growers Cooperative and the alternate requirements established by the Department of Labor. They argued that the proposed pay scales for certain irrigation tasks were not consistent with legal standards and claimed the Department of Labor should not have allowed certain job qualifications that tied higher pay to proof of specific verbal or written references. These farmworkers expressed fears that varying pay rates and additional criteria could disadvantage U.S. agricultural laborers.

 The irrigation work in question involved the movement of lines through fields in multiple counties in Idaho. Valley Growers Cooperative differentiated pay based on line type—such as wheel lines with mechanical parts and hand lines of various diameters—and topographical challenges. Delgado discussed difficulties arising from line-specific pay structures and the possibility of delayed referrals when applying for irrigation work. Silva pointed to an experience-reference rule that kept him from securing a higher-wage irrigation position because he lacked twenty days of verifiable experience. Ramos worried about the indirect effects of these pay policies given his past fieldwork and possible future moves into irrigation roles.

 One set of arguments emphasizes that 8 U.S.C. § 1188(a) and related regulations—such as 20 C.F.R. §§ 655.100(b) and 655.102(e)—permit employers to submit wage proposals reflecting factors like terrain, equipment size, and skill requirements. Valley Growers Cooperative contends that its pay structure is based on legitimate operational variances and that its experience and reference rule is a reasonable way to ensure workers are adequately qualified. It further contends that federal rules do not prohibit differentiating wages for distinct types of irrigation lines so long as there is no adverse overall effect on domestic employment.

 Another set of arguments maintains that the proposed wages and requirements place unwarranted burdens on U.S. farmworkers, contrary to legal safeguards protecting domestic labor. Drawing on principles from case law ensuring that domestic workers’ opportunities remain unharmed, Delgado, Silva, and Ramos assert that the higher-wage reference requirement, along with delayed hiring processes, unfairly reduces their ability to secure better-paying irrigation roles. Moreover, they contend that lower wage rates in certain Idaho settings can suppress income for individuals who would otherwise move or change tasks within the agricultural sector. They seek both declaratory and injunctive remedies to lift these alleged barriers and improve the prospects and earnings for domestic farmworkers who lack the specified references or do not meet the stated experience threshold.
