You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A dispute arose over a patent dealing with a molded foam innersole that featured an elastomeric insert. Company S held this patent, and Company R was accused of infringing it. Before a certain cutoff date in October of a given year, there were discussions about whether Company S’s innersole had been offered for sale. Company R pointed to multiple interactions between Company S and Company T, a separate business division of Company U, suggesting that Company S may have quoted costs or sent materials that could have been construed as commercial activity. Company S, however, maintained that all discussions and shipments were part of ongoing development of the innersole and not a final commercial transaction.

 Evidence showed that Company S’s inventors—Person A, Person B, and Person C—spent considerable time refining the tackiness of the elastomeric insert so it would stay properly in place during foam injection, preventing seepage under the insert. Company S insisted that extensive experimentation was taking place and that no firm sales arrangement existed. Company R countered this by pointing to documents, including at least one letter referencing a “projected unit cost” and another that mentioned having the products ready. According to Company R, the paperwork implied that any remaining technical issues were minor and did not alter an otherwise commercial offer. Company S, however, emphasized that no definitive price per product or binding contract terms had been presented to Company T, and that any cost information was purely preliminary.

 Another area of contention was the calculation of damages if an infringement were found. Company S argued that only certain specialized products—referred to here as “Zeronite” inserts—were acceptable noninfringing alternatives, and therefore it was entitled to lost profits based on a narrow market. Company R disputed that and maintained that many other foam-based innersoles were also viable substitutes, which, in its view, should reduce or eliminate any lost profits portion of damages. Company R further challenged the royalty figure Company S proposed for some pairs of innersoles, insisting that the actual royalty rate should be set lower, given other available options in the market.

 In favor of Company R winning, one set of arguments emphasized that interactions before the cutoff date showed a sufficiently definite sale or offer for sale, satisfying the requirements of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). According to these arguments, a product feature need not be entirely perfected to be considered on sale, especially when documents contain cost projections or identify that the product is available. The legal position referenced precedents highlighting that only a clear and convincing showing of commercial activity is needed to trigger the bar, regardless of ongoing refinements. Moreover, it was contended that the statutory policies behind an on-sale bar—encouraging timely patent filing and preventing removal of technology from the public domain—support shutting the door on patents covering products introduced commercially before the cutoff date. Company R’s position also drew upon the notion that any further testing done by Company S was insufficiently tied to the essential claimed feature, meaning it did not constitute an experimental exception.

 In favor of Company S winning, another set of arguments stressed that no completed or market-ready innersole existed prior to the cutoff date. The insert required considerable further experimentation to acquire the correct tackiness for proper positioning. Citing the experimental-use principle, these arguments underscored that all interactions with Company T were for trial purposes, not for an actual sale. The asserted communications with Company T were portrayed as nothing more than preliminary negotiations, with no binding terms such as a firm price, quantity, or delivery schedule. Under precedents dealing with experimental use, because the product was not shown to be fully operable, any apparent commercial overture was really part of the development process. As to damages, these arguments insisted that the unique nature of the innersole meant few or no viable alternatives existed. Consequently, a higher royalty rate would have been justified if infringement had been shown. By that reasoning, any cost references were only best approximations of a product still under experimentation, not an indication of a definite commercial transaction.
