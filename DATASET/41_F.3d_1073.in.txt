You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Marion F. Brant School is a private institution serving primary and secondary students in Greenview’s Bridgeport District. Under its hiring process, the principal, Mason King, has final decision-making authority concerning the recruitment of new teachers. The school uses a salary structure linking pay to years of teaching experience, which it also has historically applied to external new hires. In 1988, after a drama teacher left the faculty, Mark Russell—who led the drama department—was asked to find a replacement. Mason King informed Russell that the position could not exceed a certain salary limit due to budgetary concerns.

 Three candidates were ultimately interviewed for the open drama teaching position. On March 27 of the following year, the school selected April Rogers, who then had one year of prior teaching experience, and offered her a salary below the stated maximum. Meanwhile, Russell learned about another educator, Jacob Harris—an individual aged over forty with thirty years of experience—when a separate instructor brought Harris’s details to Russell’s attention. Harris was informed that he would not be hired partly because his teaching experience would elevate him to a salary level beyond the school’s budgetary limit. Harris alleges that the timing of his application was never cited as a reason for excluding him, while Russell contends that the recruitment was already near completion when Harris’s materials were received.

 The EEOC brought suit on behalf of Harris, asserting that Marion F. Brant School’s actions ran afoul of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In its filings, the EEOC described both a claim of intentional exclusion of older applicants and a claim that the school’s policy of correlating pay with experience, in conjunction with instructing Russell to cap the available salary, caused a disproportionate disadvantage for individuals over forty. During the litigation, the parties and the courts explored precedent interpreting statutory provisions under the ADEA, including considerations of whether a correlation between years of service and age sufficiently established a claim of age-based discrimination.

 In support of the view that Marion F. Brant School’s hiring practice did not amount to unlawful conduct, several arguments referenced the text of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The school’s position highlighted prior interpretations of the statute—particularly discussions in cases such as Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins—indicating that employment decisions motivated by budgetary or service-linked considerations do not necessarily equate to discrimination because of age. The school asserted that it adhered to a neutral practice of tying salary to teaching experience, a system which it claimed served legitimate organizational needs and economic realities. Proponents of this perspective underscored that, under 29 U.S.C. § 623(f), the ADEA allows for differentiations based on reasonable factors other than age, and that a pay scale tied to experience was an acceptable method of offering fair compensation.

 In favor of the EEOC’s contention that the school’s practice unfairly affected older workers, several arguments drew from established principles in Title VII jurisprudence, including the frameworks set forth in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. By emphasizing that an apparently age-neutral pay cap had a disproportionate impact on applicants over forty, the EEOC’s position insisted that the policy effectively screened out older individuals at a higher rate, even if implemented without a consciously discriminatory motive. This line of reasoning held that, given the ADEA’s core purpose to root out reliance on inaccurate stereotypes about older workers’ abilities, the presence of a statistical disparity could suffice to demonstrate a form of discrimination. Advocates of this approach invoked the idea that the school’s rationale for rigidly applying a longevity-based pay scale, in the face of willing older candidates, might mask an unexamined presumption favoring younger candidates or be an unintended carryover of stereotypical assumptions at odds with the ADEA’s commands.
