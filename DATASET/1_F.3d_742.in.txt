You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Late one night, Officer Grey of the Parkview City police stopped a car being driven without its headlights. Linda Baker was at the wheel, and Peter McKay sat in the front passenger seat. Baker stated that she did not have a driver’s license and that the car belonged to Russell King, an acquaintance of hers who was not present. Officer Kelly, arriving at the scene, saw McKay bend forward in his seat when the car first came to a stop. The officers ran a computer check and learned that McKay had a prior conviction. During this encounter, Officer Adams appeared and mentioned seeing the same vehicle, under a different license plate, the previous night.

 The officers asked Baker and McKay to step out of the car. As McKay left, Officer Kelly patted him down and discovered that McKay was wearing a shoulder holster with no weapon in it. He was asked about the location of any gun, and McKay responded that he did not have one and was not permitted to carry one. A subsequent search of the passenger area revealed a loaded .44 caliber Norwin Firearm revolver under McKay’s seat, which the officers tested for fit in the holster. McKay was then charged with illegally possessing a firearm. Some days later, Russell King was arrested in a separate incident with a gun discovered under the seat of a different car that he was using at the time.

 At trial, McKay sought to introduce official reports and testimony describing King’s arrest and the discovery of King’s gun under the driver’s seat. McKay maintained that this evidence was critical to the question of who actually possessed the revolver in King’s car the night McKay was charged. McKay also contended that the stop of the car was invalid and that the pat-down search, as well as the seat search, happened without proper justification. During closing arguments, McKay’s counsel attempted to highlight similarities between the revolver under McKay’s seat and King’s later gun, prompting the prosecutor to object that those facts were not fully in evidence. McKay also argued that comments made in front of the jury during closing unfairly undermined his defense.

 In defense of its case, the Government invokes laws and principles related to valid traffic stops, including the authority under Delaware v. Prouse to detain vehicles operating with unaddressed equipment issues, and highlights the justification for conducting brief investigative detentions when suspicious circumstances or prior records support further inquiry. The Government maintains that the officers had ample cause to pat McKay down after observing his movement toward the floorboard and discovering that McKay wore a shoulder holster. Further support is drawn from precedent permitting automobile searches under probable cause when officers detect indications that contraband or weapons might be present. Relying on Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the Government asserts that courts have broad discretion to exclude material that risks confusing the issues or unduly prolonging a trial, even if it has some potential relevance. The Government cites examples where evidence of third-party acts, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), may be excluded if it does not meaningfully establish identity or if it risks unfocused speculation among jurors.

 Peter McKay advances that he did not know about the revolver located under his seat and thus did not possess it. He points to Russell King’s ownership of the car and maintains that evidence showing King was later discovered in a similar situation would strongly indicate that it was King’s habit to store guns under the seats of cars. By invoking Washington v. Texas and other principles that secure an accused individual’s right to present a complete defense, McKay contends that all relevant, non-cumulative evidence connecting King to hiding firearms should be admitted. McKay further argues that the search and seizure were unwarranted because the officers lacked grounded suspicion to run a prolonged check on him or to frisk him, which he believes exceeded a permissible scope under applicable Fourth Amendment decisions. McKay contends he was denied a fair opportunity to demonstrate his innocence when records and testimony regarding King’s subsequent gun incident were excluded, because that material would have corroborated McKay’s assertion that the revolver beneath his seat did not belong to him and that he lacked knowledge of it.
