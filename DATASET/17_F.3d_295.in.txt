You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Clayton Fabrication, Inc. produces steel tanks for underground storage of hazardous fluids, while Dover Repair Solutions, Inc. specializes in repairing such tanks by lining them from within. The two businesses compete directly in various places where underground tank permits are required and typically issued by local fire officials. Before the events that underlie this dispute, there was no widespread resistance to Dover Repair Solutions, Inc.’s method of lining leaking tanks, which can obviate the need to remove the old tank and install a new one.

 A private nonprofit body, here called the Northern Safety Council (NSC), periodically releases revised editions of its Standard Fire Guidelines (SFG), which many local governments adopt as binding law or follow in practice. During a cycle of revisions to SFG Section 79, Gary Thompson, president of Clayton Fabrication, Inc., volunteered to participate in the SFG subcommittee focused on underground storage tanks. Although Dover Repair Solutions, Inc. was given a chance to offer information supporting the lining process, the schedule placed its presentation late in the subcommittee’s discussions. Meanwhile, Gary Thompson circulated a letter expressing doubts about the safety of tank lining and asserting that it would negate certification from Quality Certifiers, Inc.

 After hearing from Dover Repair Solutions, Inc. but without the company’s ongoing input, the SFG subcommittee approved a provision in Section 79.601(d) mandating removal of leaking tanks. That addition effectively blocked tank lining. The broader SFG Committee and then the full Northern Safety Council accepted the removal requirement. Even before final approval, Gary Thompson contacted multiple public officials to highlight the proposed ban, and local regulators began denying lining permits to Dover Repair Solutions, Inc. The resulting downturn in Dover Repair Solutions, Inc.’s business led to claims under federal antitrust laws and California commercial tort principles, with Dover Repair Solutions, Inc. alleging intentional misrepresentations by Clayton Fabrication, Inc.

 One set of arguments contends that Clayton Fabrication, Inc. merely engaged in legitimate advocacy protected under Noerr-Pennington principles, emphasizing that neither the Sherman Act nor state tort law should restrict truthful or even contentious petitioning of governmental or quasi-governmental bodies. Supporters of these arguments cite decisions including Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight and United Mine Workers v. Pennington to underscore that the injuries claimed stem from official acts by public decision-makers, rather than any purely private agreement. This view often asserts that the applicable statutes and doctrines, such as Parker v. Brown and City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, insulate the right to seek intervention by governmental bodies, maintaining that rigorous scrutiny of underlying motives would chill legitimate efforts to influence public policy. Proponents also highlight that state tort liability should be similarly limited if the harm alleged results from the decisions of officials rather than direct market conduct, pointing to policy rationales that safeguard access to government entities even when commercial interests drive the advocacy.

 Another set of arguments contends that Clayton Fabrication, Inc. went beyond legitimate advocacy by offering deceptive statements to the SFG subcommittee. Under the reasoning advanced in Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., these actions would not amount to a protected petitioning of government if the process was effectively manipulated to exclude fair debate and thereby impose a restraint on competition. This perspective emphasizes that misrepresentations about the safety and certification status of the lining process prevented regulators from receiving objective, accurate information. Supporters of this view also argue that Clayton Fabrication, Inc. could be liable for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage under California law, citing authority that makes it unlawful to engage in deliberate falsehoods that cause business losses. Additionally, some point to Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau to advance the notion that deliberate misrepresentations within an otherwise valid lobbying effort are not invariably shielded from legal responsibility. These arguments conclude that altering a model safety guideline through such questionable methods imposes a direct harm beyond mere political persuasion.
