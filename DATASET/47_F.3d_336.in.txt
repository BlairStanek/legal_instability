You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The Carter Family are citizens of Fiji who left their home in the wake of political upheaval that followed a coup in that country. Jordan Carter, the father, had worked in Fiji as both a cook and a taxi driver. After leaving Fiji, the family entered Canada briefly and then came to the United States. Once in the United States, they sought asylum, stating that they feared being persecuted based on their background and their associations.

 According to Jordan Carter’s testimony, he was stopped at a roadblock by several individuals—some in uniform and others in civilian attire—and taken to a local station, where he was placed in a cell. While there, he was struck physically and questioned about his involvement with the Workers Union, which he supported by distributing pamphlets and taking part in activities. He was released several hours later but worried that he would face similar or worse treatment if he persisted in his political involvement. Additionally, the Carter Family reported that stones were thrown at their residence and that they felt targeted due to tensions between ethnic groups in Fiji.

 The family members also described various forms of harassment. Laura Carter, the mother, stated that she was subjected to threatening behavior by members of the military on multiple occasions, though few specific details were provided. She additionally claimed that one of her relatives was murdered and that this relative’s spouse was attacked, without clarifying why such acts occurred. According to the family, efforts to seek assistance from authorities proved unhelpful, and reports to law enforcement were either disregarded or never acted upon.

 In support of the Board’s position, arguments highlighted that asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) requires evidence of persecution tied to a protected ground—such as race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion—and that the evidence must include credible, direct, and specific facts demonstrating a reasonable fear of such persecution. Key cases, including INS v. Elias-Zacarias and Estrada-Posadas v. INS, emphasize a deferential standard of review toward factual findings by administrative tribunals. The Board’s side reasons that sporadic harassment, brief detentions, or actions by unknown assailants do not necessarily constitute political persecution unless a clear link to a protected ground is firmly established by the petitioner. Furthermore, reliance on authoritative materials such as a State Department Country Report may support concluding that conditions in Fiji do not automatically create an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.

 In favor of the Carter Family, arguments stress that Jordan Carter’s account of physical harm, arrest, and interrogation at the hands of uniformed personnel—particularly with explicit references to his activities in the Workers Union—demonstrates more than mere harassment, suggesting targeting for political opinion. Legal authorities such as Desir v. Ilchert and Del Valle v. INS are invoked to show that physical force, even over a short period, accompanied by pointed accusations regarding political affiliation, can amount to persecution. This side contends that the family’s experiences—being beaten, threatened, and effectively ignored by local authorities—reflect a real, credible risk tied directly to their political stance, thereby meeting the requirement of proving past persecution for asylum eligibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).
