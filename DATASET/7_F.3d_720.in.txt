You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Kenning Brothers is a group of farmers and grain-related businesses that sold or stored grain at a facility operated by Fowler Grain. Kenning Brothers, along with Keystone Assurance (which issued a warehouseman’s bond), contends that a series of inspections by the United States Department of Agriculture was improperly conducted, resulting in economic losses. Fowler Grain’s facility was federally licensed for grain storage, and Kenning Brothers claims it relied on the license status and inspections when deciding to deliver grain and conduct business there.

 In spring of one year, United States Department of Agriculture inspectors visited Fowler Grain’s warehouse and noted shortages in corn and soybean inventories. Afterward, the inspectors directed Fowler Grain to correct the deficiencies and to comply with warehouse regulations. That August, a special inspection took place, allegedly to check whether Fowler Grain had remedied prior shortfalls. The inspection reports did not clearly assess all past deficiencies, and Fowler Grain continued operations. In the following weeks, Kenning Brothers continued to store and sell grain through Fowler Grain, and Keystone Assurance issued a new warehouseman’s bond.

 By mid-autumn of that same year, United States Department of Agriculture inspectors uncovered substantial new shortages at Fowler Grain. Subsequently, the federal license was suspended, and the warehouse’s grain inventory was liquidated. Proceeds were distributed on a pro rata basis to those with valid claims, but the amounts did not fully compensate Kenning Brothers. Suit was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act based on the inspectors’ alleged failure to follow established protocols, arguing that a proper inspection would have led to earlier discovery of the shortages and prevented further losses.

 Kenning Brothers argues that the United States Department of Agriculture’s inspection policies contain specific mandatory procedures that were not followed, thereby forming a complete basis for liability. They rely on precedents holding that if government regulations or handbooks prescribe a precise course of action, then the discretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act is inapplicable. They further contend that no broad policy considerations authorized disregarding clear, mandatory inspection guidelines, and that any failures in these inspections directly prevented proper oversight. They also assert that their theory of liability centers on negligent breach of a regulatory duty, rather than on miscommunication, invoking the principle that a claim of negligence in carrying out mandated tasks need not be treated as a claim of misrepresentation barred under the statute.

 The United States answers that decisions regarding inspections, licensing, and potential suspensions under pertinent laws involve discretion grounded in policy, such as balancing economic and logistical considerations related to regulating warehouses. It cites the statutory language that grants broad discretion to decide whether and when to revoke a grain warehouse license. From this point of view, any claimed omissions or failures by the inspectors to act are inseparable from the overarching authority of the decisionmakers who weigh policy factors when determining enforcement steps. The United States also emphasizes that the Federal Tort Claims Act’s misrepresentation exception should apply if the essential harm alleged flows from reliance on what the inspectors did or did not communicate about Fowler Grain’s compliance or overall stability. Under this argument, the government’s actions in evaluating a warehouse for compliance fall squarely within a sphere of judgment shielded by the statutory exceptions.
