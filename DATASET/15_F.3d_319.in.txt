You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Conrad Jones was an attorney in North Carolina who was held in direct criminal contempt by a trial court in Hadley County. The contempt finding arose during a pre-trial hearing addressing the representation of Roger Blake, a defendant facing criminal charges that had prompted heightened public interest. At that pre-trial hearing, tensions flared when the judge, Judge Donovan, sought to clarify the appropriate counsel for Roger Blake. During the hearing, Jones tried to speak multiple times despite court orders instructing him to sit down. Roger Blake also interjected with disruptive outbursts. In response, courtroom staff followed the judge’s instructions regarding order in the courtroom. Jones was subsequently charged with direct criminal contempt for allegedly disobeying the judge’s directives and contributing to the disruption.

 Jones had made an earlier “limited appearance” in the proceedings related to Blake, while Arthur Henry (a visiting attorney licensed elsewhere) and Benjamin Cole (another visiting attorney) had also appeared in association with an appointed public defender, David Lane. Confusion arose because prior orders stated that David Lane alone was recognized as counsel. Jones nonetheless sought to be heard on Blake’s representation, and the judge told him to be silent because, in the judge’s view, only Lane was recognized as counsel. Moments later, Blake launched further disruptive statements. Ultimately, the judge ordered Jones removed from the courtroom and specified that he would later face contempt charges.

 Two days after the incident, Jones returned to the courtroom for the contempt proceeding. Jones requested that the hearing be before another judge, citing concerns about impartiality and the judge’s conduct inside and outside of court. The request was denied, and the case proceeded as a direct contempt matter. At the hearing, Jones was permitted to have counsel, question witnesses, and testify about his intentions in addressing the court on Blake’s behalf. Jones insisted he had not intended to undermine the proceedings but believed he was acting for the legal benefit of Roger Blake. The trial court, referencing Jones’s repeated calls to speak despite instructions to remain silent, found him in contempt and imposed a sentence including jail time and a fine. Jones served the sentence and paid the fine, then challenged the contempt conviction by petition for habeas corpus.

 The State of North Carolina has argued that courts have broad power to maintain courtroom order, including issuing direct criminal contempt citations when an individual disregards a judge’s instructions. The State points to statutory provisions that permit a judge to sanction any willful behavior likely to disrupt proceedings or disobey the court’s direct orders. In their view, the State underscores that, when a person clearly understands a judge’s command to stop speaking and instead persists, that conduct falls within the statutory definition of willful disruption. The State also contends that any technical questions about representation or substantive objections to the judge’s prior rulings cannot serve as a defense to ignoring a clear order from the bench, referencing authorities such as Walker v. Birmingham and Howat v. Kansas for the proposition that one must first obey a court order before challenging its validity through established legal channels. Furthermore, the State emphasizes that immediate courtroom disturbances—especially where another participant is unruly—necessitate swift judicial authority to maintain dignity and safety, consistent with statutes allowing summary contempt proceedings.

 Conrad Jones maintains that his actions stemmed from a legitimate attempt to clarify important questions about a defendant’s right to counsel of choice. He urges that a court may not override, without a proper hearing, an attorney’s appearance for a defendant who wishes counsel beyond the appointed lawyer. Jones argues that he was advocating a legal position about ensuring proper counsel, claiming that his statements did not amount to a deliberate flouting of judicial authority. In his view, the fundamental due process requirement of impartial adjudication was compromised because the same judge who felt provoked by what occurred in the courtroom adjudicated the contempt. Jones cites Mayberry v. Pennsylvania and Taylor v. Hayes to support the principle that, when a judge believes a participant’s conduct has personally targeted and inflamed the judge, a separate decision-maker should preside over the contempt hearing. He also argues that collecting witness affidavits and speaking with a media outlet in advance of the contempt hearing demonstrated that the judge developed a personal, rather than adjudicative, stake in the alleged misconduct. Thus, Jones concludes that a more extensive hearing, before a different judge, was necessary to protect due process.
