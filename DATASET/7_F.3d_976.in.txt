You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Adams was subject to a large tax assessment by the Internal Revenue Service. Adams disputed the assessment while incarcerated in a federal prison located in Meadowtown, Alabama, assigning a power of attorney to Morgan and another individual to assist with administrative challenges. Due to an error in not posting the assessment properly to Adams’s taxpayer account, the Internal Revenue Service’s computer mistakenly generated a sizable refund check made payable to Adams and Adams’s ex-spouse, which was mailed to an address in Dunville.

 Adams’s ex-spouse, following instructions from Adams, deposited the check in an account in Greenport, with Adams providing written confirmation of his endorsement. Soon after, Morgan accepted funds from Adams to open several bank accounts in different locations. Over some weeks, Morgan engaged in multiple transactions—often staying below the cash reporting threshold—that involved purchasing and cashing numerous cashier’s checks at banks in Greenport, Lackton, and Newhaven. Morgan also traveled, transacting at a racetrack in Ventura and a casino in Brighton. Meanwhile, Adams, still in custody, provided directions and maintained that the underlying tax assessment had been more than covered, making the refund legitimate.

 The Internal Revenue Service discovered its error and demanded repayment, but Adams declined. In the ensuing investigation, evidence showed extensive movement of money through a complex network of financial instruments and accounts. Morgan gave various explanations to bank officials and also made statements to government agents about her knowledge of the funds. By the time charges were brought under 18 U.S.C. § 641 and related statutes, both Adams and Morgan claimed they believed the Internal Revenue Service’s assessment had already been fully satisfied. On the other hand, the government insisted it retained an interest in all mistakenly issued Treasury funds. In litigation, the focus centered on whether the proceeds remained government property and whether Adams and Morgan had acted with unlawful intent.

 In support of the position that the funds still belonged to the United States, arguments relied on the text of 18 U.S.C. § 641, emphasizing that it protects government property against conversion in broad terms. Citing precedent such as Morissette v. United States, proponents of this view contended that the government retains a property interest in an erroneous Treasury issuance even when the recipient lawfully obtains initial possession. They argued that a purpose of federal law is to prevent the unauthorized retention of property that the government never intended to convey and that the choice of statutory language—covering “knowing conversion” in addition to theft or embezzlement—reflects Congress’s desire to close any loopholes that might allow defendants to exploit mistakes. The government’s position underscored that the scope of criminal liability can be established if it is shown that a recipient understood the money was not truly owed and still used it for personal gain. They maintained that the requirement of specific intent ensures innocent recipients need not fear punishment unless they deliberately choose to withhold erroneously received funds that rightly belong to the government.

 Adams and Morgan advanced several arguments that no criminal liability should attach when a government check is issued without any wrongdoing on the recipient’s part. They noted that earlier judicial decisions have recognized funds can pass beyond the government’s property interest once a recipient lawfully takes possession. They asserted that any mistaken overpayment can be recovered through 26 U.S.C. § 7405, without resorting to criminal proceedings under 18 U.S.C. § 641. They also argued that placing the onus on a recipient to detect an agency’s error leads to unreasonable results and undercuts the principle that criminal statutes should be narrowly construed for fairness. Moreover, they contended that their reliance on legal advice and an honest belief that the initial assessment had been fully paid negated any intent to deprive the government of its property. Under this reasoning, the absence of deliberate inducement or fraud in obtaining the check should prevent the imposition of criminal sanctions for simply taking possession of money sent as a government payment.
