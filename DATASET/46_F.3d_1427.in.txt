You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Late one Sunday evening in Iowa, an Iowa State Trooper (Officer Allen) saw a vehicle in the back of a pharmacy parking lot (Morgan Pharmacy) located in a mixed commercial and residential area of Haven City. The pharmacy appeared closed. The driver, Daniel Reese, was in the car with a passenger named John Oldham. Officer Allen noticed the car’s lights were off, and the parking lot was otherwise empty.

 Upon entering the lot, Officer Allen signaled Reese to stop after Reese seemed to turn his car around to exit. Another individual, Mark Jordan, then arrived briefly in a pickup truck but departed on Officer Allen’s request. Later, other law enforcement personnel arrived, including an Iowa State Trooper (Officer Carter), a Deputy Sheriff (Deputy Sheriff Davis) and a police dog. During the encounter, Officer Allen observed Reese drop a key from the car window. After this happened, a black leather pouch containing a white powdery substance was discovered on top of the slushy ground near Reese’s vehicle. Reese exited his car at the request of the officers.

 When Officer Allen attempted to place Reese under arrest, Reese briefly resisted. During the scuffle, Reese discarded another key. Subsequent searches of Reese’s person and the interior of the vehicle uncovered a sizable amount of currency and a small scale. Officers then located the key outside on the ground and discovered more white powder in the trunk. The white powder was tested and found to be an amphetamine-like substance. The authorities charged Reese with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute.

 One side argues that law enforcement had a valid basis to conduct an investigative stop and follow all subsequent procedures. They rely on Terry v. Ohio for the principle that an officer may briefly stop and investigate when there is reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts, pointing to the late hour, the manner of parking, and Reese’s reactions upon seeing a patrol car. The same side contends that the drop of a suspicious pouch provided probable cause, referencing Texas v. Brown and similar precedent on the “practical, nontechnical” probability that criminal evidence was involved. They also invoke United States v. Ross for the premise that once there is probable cause to search a lawfully stopped vehicle, every part of the vehicle that could conceal evidence is subject to inspection. They assert that any physical resistance to arrest served as an independent ground to justify taking Reese into custody under statutes such as Iowa Code Ann. § 804.12, noting that the objective circumstances would allow a reasonable officer to believe a crime was committed in the officer’s presence.

 The other side contends that the stop of Reese’s vehicle was unconstitutional from its inception because the facts allegedly showed no particularized and objective basis for suspecting wrongdoing. They argue that merely observing a vehicle parked in a lot at night, without more concrete evidence, does not meet the threshold set out in Terry v. Ohio and reaffirmed in United States v. Sokolow. They assert that no specific criminal activity was apparent, and thus no reasonable suspicion existed to justify the immediate detention. They further maintain that, under scenarios discussed in cases like Wong Sun v. United States, the subsequent discovery of any contraband should be suppressed as fruit of an unlawful stop, especially when the resistance to arrest was too closely tied in time to the original encounter to serve as an intervening circumstance. They argue that the seizure and search all flowed directly from an unauthorized stop and cannot be validated under the Fourth Amendment.
