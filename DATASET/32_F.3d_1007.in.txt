You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Lucy King began working as a drill operator at Kingsland Tech in an advanced engine division and later entered a program in the metal shop. She was the first woman in that shop. After joining this program, she alleges that various coworkers subjected her to repeated, offensive verbal and sometimes physical conduct of a sexual nature. Such conduct included unusually crude language directed at her and what she characterizes as degrading pranks, such as drawings and defacements left on her tools and work area.

 During her time in the metal shop, Lucy King also acknowledges she used profanities and contributed to off-color banter. Witnesses stated that her own language and demeanor were often provocative, and that she occasionally participated in conversations or interactions that centered on vulgar or offensive sexual content. Disagreements arose as to whether her contributions were evidence that she welcomed such conduct or whether she felt pressured to fit in as the only woman in the shop.

 Lucy King’s attendance record was poor, and she missed work a significant number of days. She attributes portions of her absences to stress and depression, allegedly exacerbated by the ongoing harassment and by personal circumstances, including an executed foster son. She repeatedly approached her direct supervisor, Dale Shaw, and others in management with complaints. She maintains that Kingsland Tech took inadequate measures to curb the conduct, while Kingsland Tech contends it responded promptly once a formal complaint was registered. Lucy King ultimately left her employment, later claiming that the work environment forced her to resign.

 In support of Lucy King’s claims, it is argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from unwelcome sexual harassment that alters the conditions of their employment. Placing reliance on precedents such as Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson and Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., her arguments highlight that even if vulgar conduct is widespread, an employer remains negligent if it knows or should know of harassment yet fails to take effective remedial steps. The arguments also underscore the severity of some incidents, such as explicit name-calling, offensive pranks, and unwanted exposures, as evidence of a hostile environment. Lucy King further contends that an employee’s occasional participation in coarse language does not negate the genuinely unwanted nature of ongoing harassment, especially when there is a power imbalance and only one woman is present in a previously all-male setting. She argues that such conduct, left unchecked, can cause an employee serious emotional distress and prompt an involuntary departure from the workplace, amounting to a constructive discharge.

 In response, Kingsland Tech asserts that the alleged harassment was not unwelcome in the sense required by Title VII because Lucy King routinely engaged in the same crude language and behavior she now complains of. Kingsland Tech points to Reed v. Shepard for the proposition that a plaintiff’s own actions and demeanor can demonstrate she was an active, willing participant in vulgar banter, rather than a target of discriminatory hostility. Management also disputes the extent to which Lucy King’s dissatisfaction stemmed from any harassment as opposed to broader personal issues and her pattern of absenteeism. Kingsland Tech maintains it responded adequately once it learned of specific complaints, convened meetings to address the matter, and provided avenues for Lucy King to resolve conflicts. Moreover, Kingsland Tech contends that any lingering tension in the shop was exacerbated by Lucy King’s own continued use of profane language, suggesting that no single party bore all responsibility for the shop’s atmosphere.
