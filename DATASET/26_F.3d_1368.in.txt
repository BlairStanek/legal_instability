You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Redwood Manufacturing owned a facility located in Cedarway, Ohio, operating what it called its Harborwood Division. On a specified date, Redwood Manufacturing sold the facility and that division to Greenwood Industries. The employees who had been working for Redwood Manufacturing continued performing the same tasks under the same supervisors in the same location, but they officially became employees of Greenwood Industries after that sale. These employees participated in a benefits arrangement (“the Plan”); the Plan referenced distributions triggered by a “termination of employment,” though it did not explicitly define that term.

 Before the sale, Redwood Manufacturing had circulated materials saying that employees would receive their benefits upon leaving Redwood Manufacturing’s employment. There were also allegations that a human resources representative for Redwood Manufacturing, identified by the employees, had told them the benefits would be valued at the end of the month in which the sale occurred. After the transaction, Greenwood Industries declined to assume responsibility for the Plan. Redwood Manufacturing then adopted an amendment to the Plan, effective retroactively, to permit benefits distributions when a substantial asset sale occurred; in turn, Redwood Manufacturing set a date months after the sale for calculating the value of the employees’ accounts.

 Employees argued that their relationship with Redwood Manufacturing had ended the moment Greenwood Industries took over. They pointed to the fact that they no longer received wages from Redwood Manufacturing and that, in their view, their separation from Redwood triggered distribution rights under the Plan. Redwood Manufacturing, on the other hand, deemed it a continuation of employment for these individuals, taking the stance that a transfer of the workforce to Greenwood Industries did not meet the Plan’s criteria for a termination of employment. The resulting dispute concerned whether the employees’ benefits should have been paid soon after the sale, with the value calculated at or near that date, or at a later date when Redwood Manufacturing actually processed the distributions.

 Redwood Manufacturing’s strongest arguments for prevailing are that work conditions for the employees effectively never ceased, so the Plan’s concept of “employment” was unbroken. Redwood Manufacturing contends that “termination of employment” as set forth in the Plan requires a total severance from actual work. In Redwood Manufacturing’s view, the corporate transfer alone did not trigger a distribution event, and its subsequent amendment merely clarified an existing principle that employees must truly separate before being entitled to an immediate payout. It argues that cases involving continuity of employment in corporate transactions support this stance; they emphasize that employees do not necessarily become separated for the Plan’s purposes just because their employer sells a facility. Redwood Manufacturing also cites public guidance concerning continued employment under new ownership for tax treatment, maintaining that such an unbroken continuation of work does not qualify as a termination event under the Plan.

 Greenwood Industries’ strongest arguments for prevailing likewise focus on the original wording of the Plan and the employees’ understanding that once they “left” Redwood Manufacturing, they became automatically eligible for a distribution. Greenwood Industries points out that the Plan’s language states distributions occur when an employee no longer works for Redwood Manufacturing, and that the sale severed any genuine employer-employee relationship with Redwood. It argues that even if the employees stayed in the same roles, they were not being paid by Redwood Manufacturing; thus, nonemployment with Redwood triggered the Plan’s distribution provisions. Furthermore, Greenwood Industries insists that any retroactive amendment cannot diminish or defer an already accrued right. It references interpretations of employee benefit language in which “leaving” an employer is deemed to be a separation, no matter whether the employee continues with another company. Greenwood Industries also cites the written communications from Redwood Manufacturing promising the value of accounts “when you leave Redwood,” asserting those materials clarified what the Plan truly required.
