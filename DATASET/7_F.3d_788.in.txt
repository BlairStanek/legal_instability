You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Lewis Inc. is a Minnesota corporation that purchased an insurance policy from Brookside Insurance. The policy contains an exclusion for liability incurred by any partnership or joint venture not designated as an insured. Lewis Inc. and another company, Re-Panel Inc., participated in a construction project in Redway, Ohio for a facility referred to here as the QSO project.

 Under a subcontract with Guild Builders Corp., the two companies were responsible for various aspects of a curtain wall system and exterior steel cladding for the QSO project. To facilitate this work, Lewis Inc. and Re-Panel Inc. entered into an agreement that they labeled a “Joint Venture Agreement,” opening a bank account in a single trade contractor name. Each company had specific duties: Re-Panel Inc. contributed fabrication and delivery expertise, while Lewis Inc. handled the installation and caulking. Both companies had insurance certificates listing themselves separately. They provided warranties for the finished work, and when the building later experienced leaks, both companies contributed funds and labor toward remediation efforts.

 After resolving the claims with the owner of the QSO project, Lewis Inc. requested reimbursement from Brookside Insurance for the settlement costs and defense expenses. Brookside Insurance declined coverage, citing the policy’s clause excluding certain ventures. Lewis Inc. asserted that it had not formed a joint venture, but rather a distinct business arrangement not falling under the exclusion. The written materials included references to a “joint venture,” although there was disagreement about whether that label should dictate the arrangement’s legal nature. The negotiations, the bank account structure, and the responsibilities were set out in formal documents, but the parties disputed the significance of how expenses, profits, and losses were allocated.

 One position holds that the arrangement between Lewis Inc. and Re-Panel Inc. aligned with recognized elements of a joint venture. This view emphasizes that the documents explicitly used the label “joint venture” multiple times, creating a shared enterprise for the QSO project. It points out that the agreement provided the parties with some measure of reciprocal control and responsibility for the other’s performance, established a single trade contractor entity that received all payments, and included stipulations for dividing contract costs and revenues. Citing decisions such as Ford v. McCue and related authorities, this stance maintains that dividing the contract price and assigning shared tasks and responsibilities satisfy the recognized features of a joint undertaking. The existence of mutual rights to direct aspects of the overall goal, the necessity of naming each company as an additional insured, and the apportionment of certain expenses and warranty obligations suggest an intent to enter into a joint venture arrangement contemplated under Ohio law or comparable doctrines.

 Another position insists that no true joint venture existed. It stresses that the parties did not share profits in the sense of collective gains over and above expenditures, but only split gross proceeds and allocated separate sets of costs. This perspective cites cases such as Shaver v. Shirks Motor Express Corp. to argue that dividing revenues or allocating “extras” and “deletes” does not necessarily equate to sharing net profits or losses. It observes that Lewis Inc. and Re-Panel Inc. essentially remained accountable for their own independent work segments and did not fully accept liability for each other’s obligations. This view also refers to authority stating that a consortium, in which each participant shoulders distinct tasks without assuming a fiduciary role toward the other, does not meet the legal test for a joint venture. Hence, from this standpoint, the arrangement should be deemed a consortium-like agreement, not falling under any policy exclusion reserved for joint ventures.
