You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In early March of a certain year, Jordan Nichols was living in a residence owned by a family member, situated next to the home of Victoria Evans in a city within a particular state. Nichols entered Evans’s home for a brief moment for a drink of water. Shortly afterward, Evans noticed multiple items missing from her home, including a car, keys, a purse, and a uniquely colored handgun. Evans contacted local police officers, sharing her suspicion that Nichols was involved, given that he had been alone in her kitchen immediately before her belongings disappeared.

 Later that day, city police officers observed Evans’s car being driven recklessly by someone they identified as Nichols. A pursuit ensued, and, after briefly losing control of the car, Nichols fled on foot through several backyards. During the chase, he passed through the apartment of Michael Baker, a resident who did not know Nichols. Baker would later discover a handgun with a distinctive handle left behind in his bedroom, hidden under a bed, along with a black leather jacket. Once the area was clear, Nichols returned seeking the handgun; Baker, however, had already given the weapon to the police.

 In a subsequent federal prosecution, Nichols faced charges under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). A jury was selected to hear his case. As the trial progressed, issues arose surrounding one juror’s personal obligations, which resulted in rescheduling dilemmas. This particular juror had prior holiday travel plans, and the trial court expressed concern about whether the jury could reconvene on a different day within that same week. After the original panel began deliberating, the court excused the juror with the scheduling conflict. The court then inserted Anna Cole, who had previously been named as an alternate but had already been sent away with instructions not to discuss the case. Cole returned to the courthouse under the trial court’s orders. She joined the deliberations with the other jurors, and the panel deliberated further before announcing a verdict. In subsequent arguments, various participants addressed the effect of bringing in Cole after deliberations had already started, and whether that sequence conformed with the procedural rules.

 In support of the government’s position, arguments were raised that the trial court possessed wide discretion under Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to excuse a juror for appropriate cause and that considerations of practicality justified the excusal of the original panel member due to scheduling conflicts, particularly to avoid a lengthy gap in deliberations. Supporters of this view argued that the trial court was entitled to manage the jury’s schedule in a way that minimized undue haste or pressure on the jurors. They invoked precedent holding that courts may exercise flexibility when balancing the interests of the jury system’s efficiency, such as in United States v. Tabacca, and contended that the specific circumstances—holiday timing and the potential for rushing the jury—gave “just cause” for the decision. They further noted that in the absence of any formal objection by defense counsel, the trial court’s course of action was valid under established case law permitting a judge’s discretionary rulings, particularly when an alternate has been properly admonished and remains bound by the trial court’s instructions not to discuss the case. Additionally, because there is no permanent prohibition on seating a previously chosen alternate, advocates for the government’s side emphasized that any procedural irregularity would not necessarily demonstrate prejudice so long as the alternate had abided by rules ensuring impartiality, and that the defendant would, in effect, still receive the deliberation of twelve duly sworn jurors.

 In support of Jordan Nichols’s position, arguments highlighted provisions in Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure stating that alternate jurors must be discharged once the jury begins deliberations, absent a valid, express waiver by the defendant himself. Advocates for Nichols argued that seating Anna Cole was impermissible because, in the strict sense, she had ceased to be a lawful participant the moment the original panel retired to deliberate. They cited cases, including United States v. Lamb and United States v. Foster, that underscore the requirement for an express, knowing waiver by the defendant before an alternate may be substituted during deliberations. Further, they stressed that any individual not designated a legitimate juror at the time deliberations began does not lawfully belong in the jury room, and the insertion of such a person could amount to an unauthorized presence. They contended that this procedural irregularity automatically affected substantial rights, as it allowed a participant to join the discussion and to register a vote on the verdict, thereby undermining both the structural integrity of the deliberative process and the public perception of fairness. They also maintained that the court’s instructions for the reconvened panel to “start from the beginning” did not adequately cure the defect, as the deliberations had already been underway, and there is no way to be certain that the new panel truly disregarded previous discussions or that the newly seated participant’s influence did not supplant what could have been an ongoing, evolving consensus among the original twelve.
