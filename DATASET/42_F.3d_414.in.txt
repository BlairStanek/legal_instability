You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


From 1979 until late 1989, one party, John P. Hewitt, worked for PulseCorp LLC, a company that sold and serviced ultrasound and cardiovascular devices manufactured by its European parent corporation, ItalBio Tech. Hewitt, initially hired when he was 49, rose to become Manager of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs. These devices were subject to federal oversight. After changes in ownership, PulseCorp LLC included Hewitt in a reduction in force occurring about ten months after that ownership transition. Hewitt’s final period of service ended in late 1989.

 Before and after Hewitt’s departure from PulseCorp LLC, questions arose concerning Hewitt’s prior regulatory work and performance. After his termination, PulseCorp’s president, David Hanson, occasionally employed Hewitt as a consultant for particular filings with the federal government. One such consultation addressed a device that was impounded at the border due to a missing regulatory filing. Although Hewitt’s submission to federal authorities temporarily resolved the urgent problem, it did not ultimately succeed in securing the government’s long-term approval, and PulseCorp LLC brought in an additional external consultant, Charles Rizzo, to complete further work. At the same time, the company’s leadership sometimes discussed Hewitt’s age and other personal characteristics, including in conversations about his severance arrangement.

 Early in 1991, PulseCorp LLC assumed responsibility for all regulatory affairs on behalf of ItalBio Tech’s devices, prompting the company to open a position for a Manager of Regulatory Affairs. The posted advertisement sought a candidate familiar with federal rules governing medical devices, as well as good organizational skills and the capacity to work independently. Hanson interviewed four applicants, including Hewitt, then 61. PulseCorp LLC ultimately hired a 28-year-old applicant, Jake Nelson, who had some clinical trial and regulatory experience, as well as a biology degree. One executive, Finch, kept notes describing Nelson as “young” and someone with “good growth potential.” Hewitt thereafter brought legal action against PulseCorp LLC alleging that the company’s decision not to rehire him was driven by his age.

 In support of Hewitt’s position, legal arguments focused on the idea that Hewitt had performed successfully in his previous role; his employment reviews had been positive over the years and had highlighted his skill in regulatory matters. Hewitt also pointed to the multiple times PulseCorp LLC engaged him as a consultant after his termination, presenting it as evidence the company continued to trust his knowledge. Under established precedent, such as McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green (extended to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) and subsequent clarifications, Hewitt’s side argued that any asserted lack of communication skills or recent regulatory problems were either never flagged during his long tenure or overstated in retrospect. According to this view, these discrepancies, combined with the mention of the younger candidate’s age, served as circumstantial evidence that the publicly stated reasons were unworthy of credence under frameworks adopted by courts in cases like Texas Dep’t. of Community Affairs v. Burdine. Hewitt’s advocates contended that a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that age formed the decisive factor.

 On behalf of PulseCorp LLC, legal arguments stressed that the company’s selection process sought strong communication abilities and clinical trial background to manage a broader scope of regulatory work than Hewitt had previously handled. Referencing a line of precedent which allows an employer to set its own criteria for performance (for example, in Palucki v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.), PulseCorp LLC maintained that needing new or more diverse skills was a legitimate business consideration. The company relied on newly discovered issues with Hewitt’s past regulatory files, discovered by Charles Rizzo and David Hanson, to show that the earlier favorable reviews did not delve into the depth and detail of Hewitt’s filings. Citing cases emphasizing that courts should not second-guess employers’ business judgments, PulseCorp LLC contended that even if Hewitt’s major experience was constructive in the past, the firm reasonably concluded that Nelson offered a better combination of talents for the significantly expanded regulatory functions.
