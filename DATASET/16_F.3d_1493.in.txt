You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Frank and Morgan both responded to a mailed advertisement for a broker called BetaInvest. Jordan, working as an account executive at BetaInvest, introduced them to commodity futures options, including options for agricultural products. Early in their discussions, Jordan allegedly mentioned that some of his previous clients had achieved large profits in similar trades. Frank and Morgan later placed orders to buy options through Jordan, paying both the option cost and a commission to BetaInvest.

 According to Frank and Morgan, Jordan downplayed the risks of commodity futures options, focusing on the possibility of significant returns in a short period. Frank and Morgan believed they were entering a market made highly favorable by adverse conditions in the Central Region’s farmlands, a circumstance they thought would drive grain prices upward. During the same period, Frank and Morgan also opened and maintained a trading account with another brokerage firm (here called Anderson Global), where they continued to invest in various futures and other financial products. Frank and Morgan alleged that, despite explicit disclosures provided by both brokerages, they were led to believe that the real level of risk was minimal.

 Over a span of months, Frank and Morgan bought multiple options contracts through Jordan. Eventually, the value of their options fell, prompting significant financial losses. Frank and Morgan claimed that Jordan’s references to other successful clients, his assurances that profits were virtually guaranteed, and his advice to disregard or discount standardized risk disclosures caused them to invest more than they might have otherwise. They further contended that, by the time they became fully aware of the real risks, it was too late to recover the money they had put into the trades. They also claimed that they felt compelled to keep trading, even at Anderson Global, in an attempt to recoup losses that they said began under Jordan’s guidance.

 Jordan’s legal position relies on the argument that Frank and Morgan could not have justifiably depended on any alleged misstatements about risk. First, Jordan emphasizes that he provided written risk disclosure statements that explicitly warned of a high degree of danger, thus meeting regulatory requirements and negating claims of hidden hazards. Second, he contends that Frank and Morgan were not inexperienced investors in general; they already had engaged in various financial activities, including stock ownership with notable successes elsewhere, indicating they understood the speculative nature of most markets. Third, Jordan asserts that Frank and Morgan’s continued trading activity—both before and after they claimed to be fully aware of all perils—undermines any causal link between his statements and their ultimate losses. The legal authorities Jordan cites state that material misrepresentations typically must be shown to have directly caused a plaintiff’s harm, and continuing to trade or initiate new trades after recognizing the underlying risks can break the chain of causation. Cases discussing justifiable reliance under the Commodity Exchange Act are invoked to show that standardized disclosures and demonstrable awareness of risk weigh strongly against liability.

 Frank and Morgan’s legal position stresses that repeated oral statements or assurances can override the printed disclosures, especially when those statements directly negate or trivialize the written warnings about risk. They argue that even relatively experienced investors can be misled by persistent claims of minimal peril, and that each new option purchase under Jordan’s persuasion could have been driven by incomplete or misleading information. They rely on precedential authority indicating that, when a broker systematically discounts a mandatory risk disclosure or offers promises of near-certain profits, the investor’s trust in the broker’s expertise may become the operative factor in the decision to invest. Frank and Morgan also insist that the timing of their losses shows that danger was underappreciated until they were already deeply invested, pointing to decisions that hold a broker can still be liable if a plaintiff remained in or entered new positions based on the broker’s continuous assurances. They cite legal precedent suggesting that whether a client truly learned of and understood the genuine risks of commodity trading is often a factual matter, especially if a broker repeatedly insisted that low or no risk existed.
