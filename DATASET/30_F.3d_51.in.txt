You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Approximately two hundred nineteen marijuana plants and hydroponic equipment were seized during the search of a warehouse located at 9957 Lake Road in Grafton, Ohio. Detective Allan Wade of the Grafton Police Department obtained a warrant after receiving a tip from a source. Hayden Stone was identified as the individual who leased the warehouse. Connor Davis, whose name appeared on the utility records, was also charged in connection with the marijuana operation. Stone later entered a conditional plea related to manufacturing marijuana under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2, preserving the right to contest the search on constitutional grounds.

 Stone moved to suppress the seized evidence, claiming that the warrant application did not establish probable cause. Detective Wade’s affidavit mentioned that the informant had lately observed various details, including marijuana plants of specific sizes, specialized lighting, watering systems, and other growing equipment. The affidavit also recounted Officer Porter noticing two men welding the hinges on an exterior door at the warehouse. These men appeared nervous when Officer Porter approached them. No other direct confirmation of the tip was included in the affidavit.

 Connor Davis pleaded guilty but separately challenged his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He argued that U.S.S.G. § 2Dl.l(c), which equates each marijuana plant with a specific weight, was irrational and a violation of his right to substantive due process. Stone’s claim focused on whether the search warrant was valid under the Fourth Amendment, while Davis’s claim centered on constitutional questions about the guidelines.

 The strongest arguments offered in support of the Prosecution’s position are that Detective Wade’s affidavit contained sufficient detail from a source who gave a first-hand description of live marijuana plants, specialized growing accessories, and unique equipment. Reliance on Illinois v. Gates and similar precedents emphasizes that a highly specific tip can be enough to show probable cause when it provides ample detail about alleged illegal activity. The discovery of individuals welding hinges on a warehouse door, and showing nervous behavior, is argued to be an unusual and suspicious fact tending to corroborate the source’s account. Additionally, the Prosecution points to legal standards suggesting that courts should afford considerable deference to a magistrate’s probable-cause finding when a tip meets a threshold of specificity, references contraband recognizable as marijuana, and describes a criminal operation with logistical precision.

 The strongest arguments for Stone, on the other hand, center on the claim that the search warrant application rests entirely on a tip from an unknown source who had no proven track record of reliability. Under the rationale of cases like United States v. Leake, Stone’s position is that detailed accusations in an affidavit require independent police verification before officers may search a property. Absent substantial corroboration of specific factual elements, any observer could fabricate such details, particularly where the informant’s entry methods or ability to identify drugs remain unexplained. Without evidence that the informant was trustworthy or that the police had meaningfully confirmed the substance of the tip, Stone maintains that there was no probable cause to justify the warrant. In addition, Stone asserts that the mere act of welding a door shut—even if strange—does not establish a link to narcotics or validate unconfirmed allegations in the affidavit.
