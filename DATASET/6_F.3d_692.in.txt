You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, Kelly Foster served as the general manager of a construction company that had a substantial business arrangement with the Navajo Nation. Federal investigators from the FBI were examining whether wrongdoing occurred in connection with Drew Jones, the Chairman of the Navajo Nation, and sought information from various sources, including Kelly Foster. Foster was ultimately charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 for allegedly making false statements to the FBI, and also under 18 U.S.C. § 1503 for allegedly impeding the due administration of justice.

 According to court filings, the FBI, operating in Gardena, Arizona, was working with a federal grand jury to investigate allegations of corruption tied to Drew Jones. Agents interviewed Foster at Foster’s office in River City, New Mexico, regarding a vehicle that Jones had borrowed. The Government’s allegations stated that Foster provided inaccurate details about the purchase of the vehicle, the length of time Jones had possession of it, and how Foster ultimately retrieved or disposed of the vehicle.

 The defense position, as indicated in the filings, was that Foster’s statements occurred in the midst of an inquiry that the defense characterized as connected directly to an ongoing grand jury process. Foster argued that these statements were not the kind of falsehoods subject to prosecution by the FBI under those particular statutes. At the same time, the Government contended that because the FBI was also pursuing its standard investigative mandate, any false statements to those agents were made in a matter within the agency’s jurisdiction.

 In support of the Government’s side, the briefings and arguments presented for consideration cited the language of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, underscoring that knowingly and willfully making false statements in any matter over which a federal agency has authority is punishable. The Government has pointed to precedents in which even informal interviews by federal agents could trigger liability under § 1001. It has maintained that gathering information for a potential grand jury presentation falls within the FBI’s investigative jurisdiction, so any deception likewise fits the statute’s definition of a “matter within the jurisdiction” of a federal department or agency. Regarding 18 U.S.C. § 1503, the Government has argued that lying to investigators can constitute an “endeavor” to impede a judicial proceeding. Prior case law, according to these arguments, need not require a direct showing of sworn statements nor an actual success in obstructing justice, so long as the conduct was intended—under the pertinent statutes—to mislead or hamper legal processes.

 In favor of Kelly Foster, the filings and arguments stressed that statements elicited during an investigation carried out primarily on behalf of a judicial entity, such as a grand jury, may fall under what has been termed a “judicial function” exception recognized in certain court decisions. From that perspective, falsehoods expressed as unsworn statements to federal agents during a period in which the agents were acting under grand jury authority would not necessarily be chargeable under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, because the matter could be construed strictly as belonging to the judicial sphere. In addition, regarding 18 U.S.C. § 1503, those advocating for Foster’s position have underscored precedents suggesting that not all misleading remarks actually constitute obstruction, but require a concrete or at least a “natural and probable” effect of interfering with the administration of justice. The filings emphasize that general exculpatory statements, especially if agents would otherwise continue investigating, are not necessarily threats to the progress of judicial proceedings or the due administration of justice.
