You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Sam Doe created a billboard piece that contained commentary about political and social issues. He arranged with Signs Unlimited to lease a large, prominently placed billboard (the “Towering Billboard”) managed by Signs Unlimited inside a busy transportation terminal called Central Passenger Terminal, in Metro City. Sam Doe stated up front that his work was generally political, but he did not provide full details of his planned content before signing a contract. He ultimately leased the Towering Billboard for two months.

 Sam Doe’s billboard design featured a photomontage and text that critiqued Snowdrop beer and the Snowdrop family for what it called support of certain political causes in Nicaragua. The work visually likened the beer cans to missiles and raised concerns about the beer maker’s alignment with what Sam Doe referred to as “The Far Right’s political agenda.” The contract between Sam Doe and Signs Unlimited gave Coast-to-Coast Railways, as the owner of the billboard space, final authority to approve or disapprove advertising copy.

 After receiving a copy of Sam Doe’s proposed advertisement, personnel at Coast-to-Coast Railways reviewed it and declined to allow it due to the political content. Coast-to-Coast Railways had a policy, or at least a practice, of excluding ads that were purely political in nature. Coast-to-Coast Railways is structured as a corporation under federal law, with six of its nine board members appointed by the President of the United States, and it receives significant federal support and funding. Sam Doe challenged the refusal, contending that Coast-to-Coast Railways was heavily intertwined with the federal government and therefore subject to First Amendment constraints.

 One overarching argument presented in favor of Coast-to-Coast Railways centered on the view that, under the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. § 501 et seq.), Coast-to-Coast Railways is expressly designated as a private corporation rather than a government agency. That position invoked the text of the statute to argue that it is not an arm of the government for constitutional purposes. Several court precedents, including references to decisions discussing day-to-day operational independence and the limits of government involvement in corporate management, were cited to reinforce the idea that Coast-to-Coast Railways’ actions should not be deemed governmental when it decides how to manage advertising. Supporters of this argument also relied on prior rulings that private, federally funded corporations are not necessarily governmental actors if the federal government does not heavily control their daily decisions, and therefore they are not subject to the First Amendment when exercising editorial or advertising discretion.

 An equally forceful argument, put forward in opposition, stressed that the federal government’s deep involvement in Coast-to-Coast Railways’ organization—particularly the fact that a majority of its board is appointed by the President—combined with substantial federal financing, indicates pervasive control. On that basis, it was argued that Coast-to-Coast Railways’ conduct in deciding which advertisements to permit or ban is effectively governed by constitutional standards. This side also relied on cases emphasizing that if the government creates, funds, and retains significant oversight authority over a corporation, the corporation’s decisions—especially those involving speech—can be treated as governmental action for purposes of the First Amendment. Supporters of this view pointed to statutory provisions that grant the government broad influence over key aspects of Coast-to-Coast Railways’ structure and finances, bolstering the contention that it is obligated to follow constitutional free speech principles in regulating expressive displays.
