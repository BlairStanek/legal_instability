You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In November of 1990, law enforcement officers from the Lakeside Police Department conducted an undercover operation targeting suspected drug activity at an apartment located on Pine Street in Lakeside City. During a controlled purchase, one individual, Linda Reyes, allegedly instructed Diana Morris, who was under the age of twenty-one, to hand over a small amount of crack cocaine in exchange for money. The police later searched the apartment after obtaining a warrant. Inside, they found multiple individuals, including Ms. Reyes, Ms. Morris, and the father of Ms. Morris’s child. They also discovered various items such as traces of cocaine, a scale, packaging materials, firearms, and ammunition, as well as a safe in Ms. Morris’s bedroom. Ms. Morris told authorities that the drugs and weapons belonged to Andrew Carter. Although no identification for Mr. Carter was found in the room, Mr. Carter’s fingerprints were allegedly lifted from the door of the safe and from a scale inside it.

 Police officers measured the distance between the apartment’s back door and a nearby school, Bridge Elementary School, noting that it was approximately twenty feet away. Based on the evidence collected, including the statement by Ms. Morris, a federal grand jury indicted Andrew Carter on several charges covering drug distribution, possession with intent to distribute near a school, and use of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense. A warrant was then issued for Mr. Carter’s arrest in February of 1991.

 When Mr. Carter was arrested in February of 1991, officers recovered from him a semiautomatic pistol with a defaced serial number, a telephone pager, and a key that reportedly fit the same safe located in Ms. Morris’s bedroom. Additional charges were subsequently added regarding the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, along with the prior drug charges. Before trial, Mr. Carter requested that the charges related to the November incidents be separated from the charges related to the February arrest. He also requested that his trial be separated from Ms. Reyes’s trial. Throughout the proceedings, the scope of admissible evidence, such as whether the pistol and pager should be considered relevant to the earlier alleged drug activities, became a central point of contention.  

 Those favoring a finding in favor of The United States invoke several arguments centered on the scope of federal criminal statutes and evidentiary rules. They rely on statutes such as 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 18 U.S.C. § 924 to highlight Congress’s broad power to penalize drug trafficking activity conducted near schools and to impose additional penalties for the presence of loaded or operable firearms in the context of a drug offense. It is argued that evidence of any weapon or device typically associated with drug transactions—such as a pager—demonstrates intent, motive, and knowledge, making it relevant under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Furthermore, supporters of The United States’ position stress that Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) allows the introduction of certain extrinsic acts if they are probative of elements like intent and knowledge, rather than just character. They also emphasize the importance of judicial economy under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, arguing that multiple charges can be tried together if they form part of a common plan or are interconnected by evidence of continuing conduct. By pointing to the fingerprints on the safe, the matching key, and the items found on Mr. Carter’s person, proponents contend that it is logical to infer that Mr. Carter had ongoing control over both the weapons and drugs, making the evidence from the February arrest pertinent to the earlier charges.

 Those favoring Andrew Carter present separate arguments based on potential prejudice and evidentiary restrictions. They contend that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 supports severance when multiple counts risk confusing a jury, particularly where evidence from one offense could prejudice the jury’s perception of another. They also rely on Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) to suggest that a subsequent act—possession of a gun and pager months after the alleged drug activity—should not be introduced merely to demonstrate Mr. Carter’s character or a supposed propensity for drug dealing. They argue that the gun and pager, standing alone, do not automatically tie Mr. Carter to the earlier drug distribution accusations and could mislead a jury into believing that carrying a weapon in February meant criminal behavior in November. Furthermore, they maintain that these items fail the relevance test under Federal Rule of Evidence 401 because the significant passage of time and lack of direct connection between the events undermines any claim that they clarify Mr. Carter’s earlier intent. According to this viewpoint, the cumulative risk of confusion and unfair prejudice warrants separate trials or the exclusion of the later-seized items.
