You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1984, Johns Gas Company constructed a new service station in Stoneville, West Virginia. After completion, Johns Gas Company leased the station to Rowan under a franchise agreement, which included monthly rent and the requirement that Rowan purchase gasoline. Their lease was renewed in 1988 to run until early 1992. In 1991, Johns Gas Company decided to adjust its supply system in West Virginia by moving away from certain individually run stations in favor of having independent distributors operate them.

 As part of that plan, Johns Gas Company solicited bids from several regional distributors to buy the Stoneville station. Johns Gas Company set a minimum acceptable price but received a significantly higher bid from Morgan Distributors. Johns Gas Company then extended an offer to Rowan to buy the property at the exact price Morgan Distributors had bid, explaining that Rowan had a right of first refusal under the governing statute. Rowan began discussing potential fuel-supply arrangements with other distributors, including Davis Distributors and Carver Distributors, but ultimately requested a lower purchase price instead of matching the higher bid.

 Johns Gas Company declined to alter the price, citing that Rowan could pay the same amount as Morgan Distributors. Rowan initiated legal proceedings in West Virginia, and the case later moved to the district court in Maryland. Rowan argued that Morgan Distributors had been promised a fuel supply arrangement at favorable prices and the right to display Johns Gas Company’s trademark, while Rowan had not received identical terms. Rowan contended that what Morgan Distributors purchased went beyond mere ownership of the station. Johns Gas Company responded that it was only selling its interests in the physical property and that any additional benefits Morgan Distributors possessed stemmed from separate distributor arrangements that Rowan could also have pursued with other suppliers.

 One set of arguments maintains that Johns Gas Company fully satisfied its obligations under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. Supporters of this view contend that the right of first refusal is met whenever the franchisee can acquire the station for the same monetary figure offered by a third party. They argue that markets set value, and if a legitimate third-party bid was made, then inviting Rowan to pay the identical amount ensures fairness. They suggest there is no requirement in the statute to equalize all ancillary advantages that might accrue to a particular bidder because any extra benefit follows from existing business arrangements, not from the sale of the station itself. Proponents also point to cases interpreting the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act as providing franchisors with significant leeway to secure the best price and preserve flexibility in retail fuel markets without having to adjust for every potential competitive advantage that another bidder might enjoy.

 Another set of arguments insists that Rowan was effectively offered less than Morgan Distributors, violating the franchisee’s statutory right of first refusal. Supporters of Rowan’s position claim that the package of interests Morgan Distributors obtained—encompassing not only ownership of the station but also access to relatively low-cost branded fuel and trademark usage—means that Morgan Distributors’ bid covered more than merely the real property. They say Rowan never had a genuine chance to match the full package. According to this perspective, the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act requires that a franchisee be given an opportunity to purchase exactly what the third party would receive, not just the tangible assets. They further argue that the significant difference between the station’s minimum listed price and the final bid strongly suggests that additional contractual benefits were included, undermining the notion that the offers were truly the same.
