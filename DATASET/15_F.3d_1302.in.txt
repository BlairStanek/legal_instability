You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Becker formerly worked as a truck driver for Aurora Transport, Inc. He stopped working due to a degenerative back problem and began receiving monthly disability payments under Aurora’s employee benefits plan. Under that plan, a participant qualifies for disability payments during an initial period if they cannot fulfill the usual responsibilities of their job. After that initial period expires, the benefits end unless the participant is capable of performing any work for which they are, or may become, qualified by education, training, or experience.

 Several physicians evaluated Jordan Becker to determine whether his disability payments should continue beyond the plan’s initial period. One doctor, Dr. Harold White, reported that Jordan Becker could not drive trucks and that his condition was likely permanent. Another doctor, Dr. Ronald Clare, also stated that Jordan Becker should not drive trucks or do heavy lifting and that his limitations were permanent. A specialist, Dr. Derek East, agreed that Jordan Becker could not resume work as a truck driver but believed he could still manage sedentary or light work. Sometime thereafter, Aurora Transport, Inc. and the plan administrator decided to terminate Jordan Becker’s disability benefits, citing the view that he could perform another type of job.

 Jordan Becker appealed this determination, arguing that the plan administrator had insufficient support for asserting he was able to perform any identifiable job. His attorneys also stated that he faced constraints such as an inability to stand longer than 30 minutes and a need for specialized seating. Aurora Transport, Inc. countered that no requirement existed to secure additional expert opinions beyond medical evaluations. Further, Aurora’s plan administrator concluded that Jordan Becker’s overall condition and background might allow him to carry out work that demanded only light or sedentary tasks. The dispute thus involved questions about whether Jordan Becker’s physical restrictions and education rendered him qualified, or potentially qualified, for another job role under the terms of the plan.

 The first party’s arguments center on the language of the employee benefits plan and relevant case law, including references to Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch and similar decisions. They contend that if a participant is physically able to perform sedentary or light work, and if that participant’s educational level or training could feasibly match certain job requirements, the plan’s definition of disability is no longer satisfied. They argue that the text specifying “any job for which he or she is, or may become, qualified” should be interpreted to reflect a broad range of potential workplace opportunities, not just the participant’s former position. They emphasize that formal vocational assessments are not mandated under all circumstances, especially if the medical conclusions support the notion that the participant retains enough capacity for a broad set of simpler occupations. In their view, paying benefits further would contravene the intent of the plan—namely, to encourage participants to return to work if they retain sufficient ability and background. Citing established precedent, the first party suggests that robust medical evidence showing a capability for light work reasonably meets the plan’s criteria for discontinuing benefits, so long as some combination of education and experience could enable the participant to secure such a role.

 The other party’s arguments focus on the necessity for a clear demonstration that the participant is genuinely skilled, or can become skilled, at an actual job before benefits are terminated. They maintain that the plan language referencing possible qualification by training, education, or experience does not merely involve medical abilities to perform basic physical tasks. Instead, they argue that an individualized assessment of each participant’s background, including their transferrable skills and the availability of meaningful job roles, is crucial. They point to Gunderson v. W.R. Grace & Co. Long Term Disability Income Plan and related authorities to assert that without thorough documentation—potentially aided by vocational evidence—a termination of disability benefits is unwarranted. From the other party’s perspective, it is not enough to simply declare someone fit for light or sedentary work; the plan administrator must show the participant is realistically employable in a specific capacity given their work history, educational level, and physical limitations. They contend that failing to make this individualized determination overlooks the explicit terms of the plan and deprives participants of the protections that the plan (and ERISA) are designed to guarantee.
