You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan Green was indicted by a Midvale grand jury for the murder of Walter Long. The alleged shooting occurred in Greenwood, Massachusetts. According to the record, Daniel Hill was the individual who actually shot Walter Long, and he was tried separately. Early on the day of the incident, Morgan Green, Daniel Hill, and a third person were seen entering a bar on Greenwood Avenue. That bar was not far from both Greenwood City Hospital and Townsend School, also located along Greenwood Avenue.

 Later that morning, a witness observed Morgan Green driving a yellow Pontiac with license plate 123-XYZ on Greenwood Avenue. Daniel Hill was in the front seat, and another individual sat in the back. During this drive, Daniel Hill reportedly fired a handgun out the passenger window and killed a cat. Around noon, Morgan Green’s Pontiac was parked a short distance down Elm Way from Greenwood Avenue. Around that same time, Walter Long—who had told his former spouse he would be walking west from Berger Plaza—was shot multiple times by Daniel Hill on Greenwood Avenue. Daniel Hill then ran diagonally to the Pontiac and got in, whereupon the car sped away. Eventually, the Pontiac ran a stop sign and collided with another vehicle at the intersection of Taylor and Clark Streets. When questioned by police, Morgan Green allegedly gave inconsistent statements about whether anyone else had been in the car. The police later found .38 caliber ammunition in a brown paper bag on the passenger side floor.

 Supporters of the charges pointed to the circumstances—such as Morgan Green’s apparent waiting on Elm Way, the high-speed departure immediately following the shooting, and later comments to the police—as indications that Morgan Green was aware of Daniel Hill’s plan to harm Walter Long. Others emphasized the absence of clear evidence proving that Morgan Green knew in advance of any intention to kill. They argued there was no direct evidence of Morgan Green’s motive or that he had conspired with Daniel Hill, and contended that Morgan Green’s actions might at most show assistance after the murder rather than an intent to facilitate it. Multiple court proceedings in the state trial court, the intermediate state appellate court, the state supreme court, and a subsequent habeas application in the district court focused on whether the evidence sufficiently demonstrated Morgan Green’s complicity beyond mere presence and post-incident assistance.

 Those who contended that the Commonwealth satisfied its burden advanced several arguments explaining why Morgan Green appeared to be a joint venturer or aider and abettor. First, they noted that Morgan Green had already been present when Daniel Hill shot the cat, indicating an awareness of Hill’s capacity for armed violence. Second, they argued that Morgan Green’s act of parking on Elm Way, close to Greenwood Avenue, suggested the vehicle was strategically positioned for a quick departure. Third, they pointed to Morgan Green’s immediate flight from the scene, along with his statements to police that appeared intended to conceal Hill’s identity, as manifestations of participation rather than innocent behavior. Finally, they invoked precedents such as Jackson v. Virginia to assert that, under settled rules permitting inference from circumstantial evidence, the jury could properly conclude that Morgan Green shared Daniel Hill’s aim. On this reading, the improbability of alternative explanations overcame any doubts about Morgan Green’s intent.

 Those contending that the Commonwealth did not prove its case posited that no direct proof tied Morgan Green’s knowledge to any plan or agreement to kill Walter Long. They sought to show that Morgan Green’s proximity to Daniel Hill and the earlier cat shooting did not automatically suggest foreknowledge of a homicide. They highlighted the lack of evidence linking Morgan Green to any motive or reason to want Walter Long harmed, and contended that parking on Elm Way could have had an innocent explanation, unrelated to a planned murder. According to this view, Morgan Green’s hasty exit from the crime scene and his misleading statements might have been the product of panic, confusion, or a misguided decision to protect Daniel Hill only after learning of the shooting. By citing Jackson v. Virginia, they argued that the inferences supporting culpability rested on unverified assumptions and that the evidence, considered in the best possible light, still fell short of proving an agreement to commit murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
