You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Barton was born in Mexico and entered the United States as a minor alongside his parents, who were lawful permanent residents. He later acquired his own lawful permanent resident status, several years after his parents. At one point, he was charged and convicted in the state trial court in California of a marijuana-related offense. Subsequently, the federal government commenced deportation proceedings against him.

 Barton argued that for purposes of calculating the necessary seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), the years during which he lived in the United States as a child while his parents were lawful permanent residents should count toward his total. He maintained that any delay in recognizing his own permanent resident status arose from an administrative processing issue. The Board of Immigration Appeals, however, took the position that Barton’s own period of lawful permanent residence was the only relevant timeframe. The dispute centered on whether Barton’s residence as a minor, prior to independently securing permanent resident status, could be imputed from his parents’ lawful domicile.

 The facts also included Barton’s consistent presence in the United States since arriving with his family, his attendance at schools in California, continuous work history, and personal ties in the country. In the proceedings, various documents and declarations from acquaintances, employers, and a school principal were submitted to show both his residence and his connection to his community. The Board of Immigration Appeals focused on the date when Barton himself officially acquired permanent resident status, while Barton’s position emphasized the length of time he had effectively been living in the United States under his parents’ lawful status.

 Those who support Barton’s position contend that the concept of domicile should be interpreted in line with common law principles, under which a child’s domicile usually follows the parents’ domicile until reaching adulthood. They note that federal immigration statutes, including 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), do not explicitly define “domicile” and that courts have often relied on a standard meaning resembling that used in other areas of the law. Advocates for Barton also point to the notion that children forming close ties in the United States are precisely the kind of individuals for whom discretionary waivers under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) were intended. They argue that the humane purpose of this relief is best served by including a parent’s lawful domicile period on behalf of a minor. They further cite precedent and commentary indicating that the statutory scheme strongly favors family unification and seeks to avoid separating individuals from parents, especially when children have long resided in the country.

 Those who support the Board of Immigration Appeals’ position rely on longstanding interpretations under cases such as Castillo-Felix v. INS, which have held that the relevant seven-year period runs only after the individual has been granted permanent resident status in his or her own right. They emphasize that the statutory text in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) requires the alien to be a permanent resident who is returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years. This, they contend, can only logically mean that the person must have both lawful status and permanent resident status as an individual for a sufficient period. They point to the importance of a clear and administrable rule, cautioning that imputing the parents’ status to children whose own formal status had not yet been recognized could undermine the consistent application of federal immigration laws and create uncertainties about when an individual’s period of lawful residence actually begins.
