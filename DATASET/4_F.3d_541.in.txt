You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


An individual named Daniels was injured by an asphalt roller designed and built by Prime Machinery Corp. He filed a strict liability suit in a state court, seeking millions of dollars in damages. Prime Machinery Corp. had a primary insurance policy with Highfield Assurance for coverage up to one million dollars and an excess policy with Evelyn Insurance Providers for coverage above that amount. After trial, Daniels received a multimillion-dollar judgment, which Prime Machinery Corp.’s insurers ultimately paid.

 In the course of pretrial communications, attorneys predicted that any eventual jury verdict could be quite high. More than once, settlement discussions arose, with figures ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars down to seventy-five thousand dollars, depending on the stage of the negotiations. Prime Machinery Corp. repeatedly expressed a belief that the asphalt roller was not defective, and it refused settlement offers that some considered reasonable. Meanwhile, Evelyn Insurance Providers communicated that settling within the primary policy limits might be prudent, but Prime Machinery Corp. proceeded to trial. After the verdict in Daniels’s favor, Highfield Assurance paid its one-million-dollar share, while Evelyn Insurance Providers paid the remainder under the excess policy.

 An agreement existed between Prime Machinery Corp. and Garfield Settlement Company, an entity affiliated with Highfield Assurance, authorizing Garfield Settlement Company to settle small claims under a certain amount. However, products liability claims and those exceeding a particular threshold were handled differently. Various parties debated whether this arrangement impacted or changed the original primary insurance contract’s terms. Conflicting accounts arose over whether Highfield Assurance had the ultimate authority to settle Daniels’s claim or whether Prime Machinery Corp. controlled that decision. Evelyn Insurance Providers sought to recoup what it had paid, arguing that Highfield Assurance negligently failed to settle within the primary coverage.

 In support of Evelyn Insurance Providers, certain legal principles recognize that a primary insurer, when it holds authority to control settlement, may owe obligations to protect an insured or other interested parties from an avoidable excess judgment. Contracts and case law, including Certain Underwriters of Lloyd’s v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America, are often cited to support the idea that an insurer exercising settlement authority should do so in good faith and with due regard for those facing exposure beyond primary policy limits. Evelyn Insurance Providers posits that Highfield Assurance was empowered to settle for an amount far below the final judgment and that this power carried with it a responsibility to act prudently. Under theories like subrogation or direct duty—discussed in cases such as American Centennial Insurance Co. v. American Home Assurance Co. and Ranger Insurance Co. v. Home Indemnity Co.—the excess insurer can assert the insured's or its own rights when the primary insurer has allegedly mishandled settlement opportunities, including failing to accept reasonable offers under the policy's limits. Supporters of this position point to policy language granting the primary insurer the option to make settlements “as it deems expedient,” arguing that this implies a corresponding obligation to settle when doing so would be reasonable.

 In support of Highfield Assurance, it is argued that Prime Machinery Corp. declined to settle because it believed the roller was not defective. Therefore, Highfield Assurance did not breach any duty by proceeding to trial at its insured’s request. Supporters note that, when an insured instructs the insurer to reject a settlement offer based on an assessment that it is not liable, the primary insurer should not be held responsible for any resulting judgment. They highlight language suggesting that Garfield Settlement Company’s contract gave Prime Machinery Corp. the actual control or final say over settlement decisions in large claims, such that Highfield Assurance lacked authority to force any compromise. Referencing authorities like Puritan Insurance Co. v. Canadian Universal Insurance Co. and Certain Underwriters of Lloyd’s v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America, proponents point out that if the insured effectively controlled litigation strategy, there can be no liability for not settling within the primary limit. Furthermore, for those states that do not recognize a direct duty from a primary to an excess insurer, Highfield Assurance contends that Evelyn Insurance Providers cannot assert any claims beyond those held by Prime Machinery Corp. itself, which had refused settlement.
