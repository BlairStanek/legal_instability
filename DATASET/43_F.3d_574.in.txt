You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On a recent election day in Alabama, several thousand absentee voters submitted ballots that did not fulfill a statutory requirement that these ballot envelopes carry either a notary’s seal or two witnesses’ signatures. Under state law, an absentee voter places the marked ballot in a plain envelope, which is then placed inside an affidavit envelope containing the voter’s sworn statement; that affidavit envelope must either be notarized or signed by two witnesses. This procedure exists so that, when those absentee envelopes are officially opened by election workers at midday on election day, only ballots that satisfy the statutory criteria may be deposited in the box and subsequently counted.

 Not long after the election, two individuals who had cast absentee ballots—along with numerous others similarly situated—filed a claim in the state circuit court in Wilson County. They asked that all improperly notarized or unwitnessed absentee ballots be counted. That court temporarily blocked election officials from excluding such ballots. Separately, Taylor, Stone, and Garcia, who had each voted and claimed that counting the disputed votes would undermine the fairness of the election, brought a federal claim under federal civil rights law. They argued that no one had ever counted absentee ballots lacking the proper witness or notary markings before and that a sudden shift would be fundamentally unfair. Local officials were caught between the state court order indicating that the disputed absentee ballots must be counted and the new federal lawsuit challenging that approach.

 In addition, certain election officers from around Alabama testified that their longstanding practice had been not to tally any absentee ballot missing either two witness signatures or a proper notary stamp. At the same time, the two individuals who originally filed in the state circuit court, later joined by various absentee voters, insisted that the relevant statutes could be read to allow counting of ballots that otherwise substantially complied—meaning they had the voter’s signature and address but lacked the exact witness or notary requirement. Many disputed ballots in multiple counties had already been opened; others remained sealed. Debate arose over whether these disputed votes might affect key statewide contests in which the tallies were tight, or might eventually prove irrelevant. Taylor, Stone, and Garcia sought to preserve all election materials while preventing final certification of any results said to include unlawfully cast votes. Meanwhile, Morgan, Parker, and Barnes aligned with the position favoring the counting of all disputed absentee ballots, claiming that the statutory language could support that outcome and that all legitimate votes should be acknowledged.

 Taylor, Stone, and Garcia posit several legal arguments to reinforce the view that improperly witnessed or unnotarized absentee ballots should not factor into final tallies. First, they rely on Alabama Code § 17-10-7, which explicitly requires notarization or two witnesses for absentee ballot affidavits, and on the longstanding statewide practice of excluding ballots without this verification. They also invoke the principle that a post-election transformation of these requirements would undermine voters and candidates who had previously relied on the more stringent understanding of the absentee ballot rules, citing cases such as Griffin v. Burns for the proposition that altering ballot standards retroactively can be fundamentally unfair. They argue that failing to follow the statute would dilute lawful votes and would also confuse or disadvantage those who might have voted absentee had they realized less formality was required. They point to the state’s interest in setting reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on voting—a recognized allowance under constitutional doctrine—and argue that the notary-or-two-witness requirement promotes the integrity of elections. Finally, they assert that a judicial directive to count ballots that do not meet the notary-or-witness standard is akin to “stuffing the ballot box,” thus causing a debasement of properly cast votes in violation of constitutional protections.

 Morgan, Parker, and Barnes counter that the statutory texts, interpreted through various state rulings, can be read to permit “substantial compliance,” so that ballots with clear voter information and an affidavit signature should be counted. They reference cases like Odom v. Bennett, in which the state circuit court reasoned that strict application of the witness or notary rule might wrongly disenfranchise otherwise qualified voters. They also contend that treating the omission of a witness signature or notarial title as a complete bar to counting an absentee ballot is unnecessarily harsh, because it is not the voter’s fault if minor defects occur. They add that in some counties, election officials have not been fully consistent about rejecting ballots for these technical flaws, indicating that not counting partially compliant envelopes now would be inequitable. Furthermore, they argue that federal courts should not intervene in a routine local election matter that state courts and elected bodies may handle, especially because the very essence of absentee voting is to accommodate persons who cannot appear at the polling place, and any rule facilitating easier voting should be weighed favorably when not explicitly foreclosed by statute. Finally, they maintain that if an unnotarized or unwitnessed ballot is valid under a reasonable reading of Alabama law, then a ban on counting it infringes on voters’ fundamental suffrage rights by effectively discarding legitimate votes.
