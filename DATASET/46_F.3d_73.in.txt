You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) was established under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to oversee savings and loan institutions, known as thrifts. The Workers Coalition, Local 9876 is the certified collective-bargaining representative for a group of OTS employees who transferred into OTS from a now-defunct supervisory authority. According to the record, these employees historically received compensation aligned with private-sector rates, a practice originally adopted by their previous employers.

 After FIRREA took effect, the Workers Coalition, Local 9876 sought to negotiate various proposals concerning compensation and benefits with OTS. These proposals included a series of annual pay increases above any existing or future merit-based raises. The coalition argued that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) granted them the right to bargain over such issues because OTS employees, whose pay was no longer entirely dictated by a federal pay schedule, fell within the FSLMRS’s scope.

 OTS, by contrast, believed that FIRREA gave its Director the authority to set and adjust compensation independently, arguing that the statutory language and legislative intent permitted wages and benefits to be determined without undergoing the collective-bargaining process. The Workers Coalition, Local 9876 sought guidance from the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), and both parties presented their positions regarding whether FIRREA specifically overrode the usual bargaining obligations in the FSLMRS with respect to setting pay and benefits.

 For the first party, it was argued that several provisions within FIRREA indicated a deliberate legislative choice to free OTS from any external legal constraints on employee pay. The first party’s view focused on language describing compensation as payable “without regard to the provisions of other laws,” which, in its reading, showed that Congress intended the agency’s leadership to have unfettered discretion over salaries and related benefits. The first party also cited statements from legislative reports expressing a desire for OTS to maintain autonomy equivalent to that of the Comptroller of the Currency, and it noted that the directive to consult other federal banking agencies did not diminish this independence. According to the first party, case precedents such as Colorado Nurses Ass’n v. FLRA demonstrated that statutory phrases removing an agency from the scope of “any other law” or “notwithstanding any other law” overcame any otherwise applicable bargaining duties under the FSLMRS. The first party additionally emphasized the importance of maintaining equal competitiveness among federal banking agencies as further evidence that Congress intended a broad exemption with respect to compensation decisions.

 For the second party, it was argued that the statutory language of FIRREA did not categorically exclude collective bargaining over compensation. They pointed out that while FIRREA does exempt OTS from certain specific provisions of Title 5, it does not explicitly mention removing OTS from the FSLMRS. The second party contended that OTS could still pay its employees “without regard” to various pay regulations yet remain bound by collective bargaining obligations when initiating or adjusting pay levels. The second party relied on the notion that statutes granting agencies the power to “fix” pay do not necessarily undo the FSLMRS unless accompanied by a clear “notwithstanding any other law” directive aimed specifically at setting compensation. Drawing on contexts where mere authority to establish compensation had not prevented bargaining, they argued that FIRREA’s legislative history—while concerned with safeguarding OTS’s budget and competitiveness—did not provide an unequivocal endorsement for completely removing negotiation rights. Furthermore, they noted that the inclusion of discrete references to certain chapters of Title 5, rather than more sweeping language, indicated that Congress did not intend to close the door on the usual federal labor-management processes in determining employee pay.
