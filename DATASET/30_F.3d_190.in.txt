You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The dispute centers on a regulation that interprets “harm,” within Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act, to encompass habitat modifications when they result in injury or death to protected wildlife. Epic Mountain Coalition, a private organization, argues that this interpretation imposes far-reaching obligations on private landowners across large tracts of land. The government, for its part, relies on that same regulation to exercise oversight over activities that could affect endangered species habitat. Both sides reference the application of possible criminal penalties under the Act, and both acknowledge that many private land use and development activities intersect directly with the regulation’s scope.

 Epic Mountain Coalition contends that a significant body of legislative history suggests that Congress did not intend to cover habitat modifications by private landowners under the prohibitions of Section 9. In support, they point to the statutory structure, noting that Section 7 of the Act expressly prohibits certain habitat modifications for federal agencies, while Section 9 (governing private parties) lacks a comparable explicit reference. The government, however, interprets “harm” to include omissions and acts with a causal link to the deaths of protected animals. Consequently, Epic Mountain Coalition and its members assert that they face extensive land-use restrictions if the government’s interpretation is applied as written.

 Practical impacts feature prominently in the conflict. Epic Mountain Coalition highlights examples in which the government’s interpretation has required private permit seekers to undertake comprehensive habitat conservation plans. These plans sometimes cover millions of acres and can include restrictions ranging from brush-clearing rules to broad development curtailments. The government points out that such measures are consistent with the Act’s protective purpose and stresses that aimless or unregulated habitat destruction could kill or injure endangered species. Both sides acknowledge that incidental take permits may be needed to lawfully proceed with various projects under Section 10(a) of the Act if the regulation is read to encompass habitat alterations.

 Epic Mountain Coalition draws on textual and contextual readings of the Endangered Species Act to advance their arguments. They emphasize that the language of Section 9, which forbids “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect,” is principally directed at intentional conduct taking direct aim at animals rather than at habitat-related measures. Furthermore, they note that Congress deliberately chose not to mirror the explicit “habitat modification” restriction found in Section 7, thus signaling that private landowners were not meant to face such broad obligations. They argue that imposing wide-ranging controls on land use under Section 9 disregards how the Act partitions responsibilities between federal agencies (under a broader set of duties) and private entities (under comparatively narrower duties). In their view, the government’s interpretation improperly expands Section 9 to regulate property management decisions on a massive scale. They also highlight select legislative history passages, arguing that Congress consciously dropped references to private “habitat modification,” and claim that reading the text to forbid all meaningful habitat changes goes well beyond the statute’s wording. Epic Mountain Coalition therefore contends that the term “harm” cannot properly be stretched to encompass habitat modifications absent a clearer statement from Congress.

 The government presents a contrasting interpretation, insisting that “harm” inevitably includes habitat alteration that kills or injures members of a listed species. They argue that the purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to prevent avoidable harm to such species by any meaningful cause, including the destruction of critical nesting or feeding areas. The government cites legislative aims to conserve entire ecosystems, maintaining that the regulatory definition of “harm” implements Congress’s broad intent to protect endangered wildlife effectively. They point to the existence of Section 10(a) permits, contending that both the statutory framework and longstanding practice support the idea of regulating significant habitat modifications. In the government’s view, limiting Section 9 to only direct physical acts against individual animals would create an unwarranted gap, undermining the Act’s objectives. They also stress that the regulation merely requires proof of actual injury or death causally linked to the modification, an approach they say is consistent with statutory text barring “take,” as well as with prior judicial and administrative interpretations that safeguard essential elements of a species’ viability.
