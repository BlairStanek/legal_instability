You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Hollins was charged under 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) for possessing a small quantity of marijuana. At all relevant times, Hollins worked as an attorney in Highland City, Michigan. An affidavit used to support a search warrant application came from Lee, another attorney who had worked in Hollins’s office before being dismissed. Lee’s affidavit alleged that Hollins regularly possessed and used marijuana in both his office and his home, and that Lee had firsthand knowledge of this behavior. Lee also claimed there had been an assault upon dismissal, and Lee and Hollins were engaged in a separate conflict over that event.

 The investigating officer, Griffin, presented Lee’s affidavit and additional documents to the district court of Highland County. These materials included Hollins’s prior record, showing that in 1974, 1975, and 1983 he had faced marijuana-related charges, though one earlier charge ended in an acquittal. The warrant described Hollins’s office, home, and vehicle. Statements were made that Hollins’s prior history and Lee’s personal observations indicated a continuing pattern of marijuana use. Hollins later challenged the impartiality of the issuing magistrate, Fletcher, claiming there was a historical dispute that could undercut neutrality. Hollins also argued that a judge at another court location, referred to by some as Lawson, might have previously been approached for a warrant and declined.

 The search conducted under the warrant uncovered about 1.6 grams of marijuana and certain related items. Hollins contended that the search warrant should have been invalidated for lack of probable cause and that the supporting affidavits were stale. He further asserted that Lee acted out of vindictiveness over the firing and that the local prosecutors had a longstanding feud with him. Hollins also raised other issues, including alleged selective prosecution, prior marijuana use testimony, prosecutorial misconduct, possible judicial disqualification, sentencing enhancements, and monetary penalties.

 In support of the search and seizure, the Government has pointed to the legal principle in United States v. Leon, arguing that even if probable cause were disputed, a reasonable and good-faith reliance on a warrant signed by a judge should allow the evidence to be admitted. Citing United States v. Calandra, the Government emphasizes that suppression of evidence is a judicially-created remedy aimed at deterring police misconduct, and should not be utilized when investigators have followed proper legal procedures in obtaining a warrant. The Government also invokes Jones v. United States and United States v. Harris to underscore that prior criminal history and the personal knowledge of a close associate, especially one who makes statements against her own penal interest, can strongly support probable cause. Additionally, it maintains that none of the factors, such as potential staleness or alleged animosity, rendered the officers’ reliance on the warrant unreasonable.

 Hollins’s strongest contentions focus on the absence of corroboration for Lee’s statements and the possibility that Lee’s affidavit was driven by malice and professional disputes. Hollins cites Brown v. Illinois and Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York to argue that the judicial process should safeguard against flawed warrants. He maintains that the magistrate in this instance was not neutral and detached because of a past confrontation, undercutting the warrant’s validity. Hollins further stresses that the older occurrences of marijuana charges were too distant in time to support a belief that he continued to possess contraband. He argues that, under this reading of United States v. Leon, no officer could have reasonably relied on the warrant when the central facts were stale, uncorroborated, and colored by personal bias.
