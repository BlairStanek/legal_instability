You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alex Jordan had served twenty years in the military, then became a civilian employee of the federal government. He worked for several years at a Veterans Administration Medical Center in City A, Kentucky, until his decision to retire from the civilian workforce at the end of 1988. He was 57 years old at that time. In finalizing his retirement paperwork, Jordan signed a document titled “MILITARY SERVICE DEPOSIT ELECTION.” Through this document, he chose not to make a deposit toward the retirement system, which was a deposit calculated at seven percent of his post-1956 military pay. Later, once he turned 62, his civil service annuity was reduced because he had not made that deposit. He also began receiving Social Security benefits, but he found that they did not make up for the annuity decrease.

 Jordan stated that he did not fully appreciate the financial impact of declining to make the deposit when he signed the form. According to Jordan, the deposit requirement was not explained in a way that spelled out the loss he would face at age 62. He believed that paying the deposit at a later date might remain an option, and he also believed that his final annuity would incorporate his full twenty years of military service plus his later civilian service. When Social Security benefits started and his civil service annuity was reduced, Jordan sought to reverse his earlier decision by attempting to make the required deposit after retirement.

 The matter became contested when Jordan asked for permission to pay the deposit and restore the credit for his military service after retirement. The agency in charge of administering the annuity system pointed to its regulations, which require that payment of this post-1956 military deposit ordinarily be done before the final adjudication of retirement benefits. Jordan responded that he had not been adequately informed of this requirement, or of the hefty financial ramifications of skipping the deposit. He also suggested several alternative methods for achieving a fair result, including paying the deposit late or rescinding his eligibility for certain benefits so that he could keep the larger military-related annuity he believed he had earned.

 The strongest arguments offered on behalf of the Office of Personnel Management rely on the statutory framework and detailed regulations designed to prevent “double credit” of the same post-1956 military years. Under 5 U.S.C. §§ 8332 and 8334, individuals who retire after a certain date can only count their post-1956 military service toward a civil service pension if they pay a deposit before retirement. A key part of this position is that the law unambiguously sets eligibility requirements and stipulates that, without the timely deposit, the civil service annuity must be recomputed to eliminate credit for those military years when the retiree becomes eligible for Social Security. They highlight that the agency’s regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 831 also specify the time frame within which an individual must pay. By pointing to longstanding precedents that reinforce the strict enforcement of deposit deadlines, they maintain that agency personnel are under no legal obligation to provide specific, individualized financial estimates, as neither the statutes nor the regulations impose such a duty. In addition, they cite case law emphasizing that, in the absence of an express statutory or regulatory requirement, any mistake, misunderstanding, or lack of special notice does not authorize a payment after retirement.

 The strongest arguments presented on Jordan’s behalf emphasize that he was unable to make an informed choice when signing the deposit election form, as he was not given crucial financial information about how his annuity might be significantly reduced once Social Security benefits began. He contends that the laws setting up this deposit mechanism do not expressly prohibit late deposits, and that the agency retains discretion to accept such payments if fairness considerations warrant. He further points to equities arising from his lengthy military service, arguing that he had already earned a vested military pension that should not have been discounted based on incomplete or unclear guidance regarding the deposit process. According to this view, basic fairness, and certain legal principles requiring that workers make retirement elections with sufficient information, support permitting him to correct his prior choice and to pay the deposit late. In Jordan’s position, nothing in the statutes or regulations explicitly directs the agency to refuse his payment at a stage when adjusting the administrative records would still be feasible, and as such, statutory and equitable principles should be read to allow him to rectify what he deems an unintentional mistake.
