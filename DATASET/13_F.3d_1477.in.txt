You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Chris Walker worked as a switchman for Riverton Transport, Inc. in Willowton, Alabama. One evening, he went to manually operate a railroad switch, which required pulling a lever mounted on cross-ties. He stepped onto a cross-tie while throwing the switch and slipped, injuring his back. Chris Walker later underwent back surgery and was unable to return to his usual job duties. He filed a lawsuit under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, alleging that Riverton Transport, Inc. did not provide him a safe place to work, did not supervise or inspect the area properly, and did not warn him about possible oil or other substances on the cross-ties.

 Riverton Transport, Inc. contended that it had satisfied its safety obligations and that the workplace conditions did not constitute negligence under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. Both parties presented multiple witnesses at the district court, with Chris Walker presenting more witnesses overall. During the trial, there was also a dispute over whether evidence of subsequent remedial measures would be allowed, and Riverton Transport, Inc. sought to exclude such evidence with a motion in limine.

 The jury received instructions covering burden of proof, causation, the duty of care, and mitigation of damages. One part of the trial involved explanations about “preponderance of the evidence,” with Chris Walker’s counsel analogizing that concept to “tipping the scales.” Riverton Transport, Inc. argued that such an analogy might be confusing when comparing the quantity versus the quality of testimony. The district court spoke to the jury about this matter and also gave a separate reminder that the weight of evidence is not determined by the number of witnesses alone.

 In support of Chris Walker, one central legal argument is that the Federal Employers’ Liability Act is intended to protect railroad employees by ensuring they have a safe place to work, and that any failure to take reasonable precautions can establish liability. Past caselaw is often cited, emphasizing that the standard for a plaintiff under the Act can be satisfied by showing that an employer’s negligence played some part—even a slight one—in producing the injury. Advocates for Chris Walker also argue that analogies such as “tipping the scales” have been authorized by various model jury instructions to clarify the meaning of “preponderance of the evidence.” They stress that the jury should be guided by whether it is more likely than not that the employer failed to clear or warn about oil on the cross-ties and that this shortfall caused or contributed to the injury.

 In support of Riverton Transport, Inc., the key legal argument is that the district court was entitled to ensure that the jury understood it must weigh the credibility and convincing force of all evidence, rather than adopt a simplistic “number-of-witnesses” approach. Riverton Transport, Inc. further asserts that guidance against “tipping the scales” language is consistent with ensuring the jury does not overlook whether the evidence truly has persuasive weight. Citing cases that stress the importance of clear instructions on the quality of proof, Riverton Transport, Inc. maintains it had fully complied with any legal obligations under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act and that Chris Walker’s injury, while unfortunate, was not shown to have been caused by negligent conditions that the employer failed to correct or warn about.
