You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alexis Brown worked part-time for GNZ Broadcasting beginning in 1979, performing production-related tasks after having advanced to a part-time production assistant role in 1981. In 1986 and again in 1988, two full-time positions opened within the company for which Brown was interested in being hired. Brown is African American, and she had filed a complaint with the E.E.O.C. after not receiving the 1986 position.

 The 1986 opening at GNZ Broadcasting was ultimately filled by a white candidate with less seniority, which sparked Brown’s E.E.O.C. filing. Brown asserted that, following her complaint, she was subjected to negative treatment by her co-workers and managers. She alleged that racial jokes were prevalent in the workplace, that offensive language was used regarding her, and that her hours and favorable assignments were reduced. In 1988, she tried to be considered for another full-time production assistant job, but she claimed GNZ Broadcasting declined to review her application or qualifications. Both incidents led to allegations that the refusal to hire was based on race, sex, and retaliation.

 During the subsequent trial, both sides presented evidence about qualifications for the 1986 position, workplace atmosphere, and personnel decisions made by GNZ Broadcasting. Conflicting evidence emerged about whether managers and employees harbored any racial bias and about the true reasons why Brown’s hours or opportunities changed. There was also testimony about Brown’s potential lost wages and benefits if she had been placed in a full-time role. A jury verdict on part of the claims introduced an apparent discrepancy in the damages awarded—one explanation suggested the jury might have attempted to award certain kinds of non-economic damages without awarding any back pay, while another view was that the jury’s finding was impossible to square with the stipulated wage difference. Some contended that if the jury determined there was a refusal to consider Brown on account of race but that she had offsetting earnings or no significant monetary loss, then its mixed damages award could be reconciled. Others suggested the award showed confusion about actual damages, given the presence of a stipulation that she would have earned more if hired full-time.

 Supporters of GNZ Broadcasting emphasized several legal grounds. First, they relied on 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and Title VII jurisprudence requiring a showing of actual discrimination in forming a contract or making a hiring decision. They argued that Patterson v. McLean Credit Union clarifies that discrimination claims must be tied directly to a contractual relationship or job denial rather than merely to working conditions. They contended that Brown was not the better-qualified candidate in 1986, pointing to alleged superior qualifications and workplace needs regarding graphic design. They invoked the principle that no adverse employment action exists without demonstrable harm and highlighted the view that the company’s managers acted out of legitimate business reasons rather than race or retaliation. They also invoked case law such as Lockard v. Missouri Pac. R.R. to stress that inconsistencies in a verdict on damages can warrant further scrutiny or redetermination. Lastly, they underscored that not all negative interactions in the workplace necessarily violate federal statutes if no materially adverse employment action, in the legal sense, is proven.

 Advocates for Alexis Brown grounded their arguments in the protections guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and Title VII, underscoring that these laws forbid employers from refusing to hire or retain someone based on race or from retaliating against an employee who advances a discrimination charge. Citing cases like Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. and Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., they maintained that courts should strive to reconcile a jury’s verdict if there is any plausible way to read the findings consistently. They also drew on Northeastern Fla. Chapter of the Associated General Contractors v. Jacksonville to argue that denial of a fair opportunity to compete for a job opening is a harm in itself under civil rights laws, even if a plaintiff cannot precisely show she would have prevailed in an unbiased hiring process. They further contended that the use of racial epithets and the alleged post-complaint hostility by several co-workers and managers evidenced a retaliatory environment, demonstrated pretext, and supported the conclusion that GNZ Broadcasting acted with discriminatory intent. Pointing to the purportedly reconcilable nature of the jury’s award, they insisted that any back pay issue did not necessarily undermine a legitimate verdict finding that Brown was denied consideration for the 1988 position because of her race or her prior E.E.O.C. charge.
