You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Cypress Healthcare Co. is a nonprofit health services organization that operates multiple facilities under the umbrella of a larger care network, renamed here as Midland Guardian Care Network. Union 789 represents several hundred nonprofessional workers at Cypress Healthcare Co. Many of these workers are smokers, and there had been prior discussions about restricting smoking inside the facilities. In the past, a 1987 revision to the employer’s smoking policy was implemented without any formal collective bargaining process.

 In late 1989, the governing body of Cypress Healthcare Co. decided to implement a smoke-free policy with an effective date of April 1 of the following year. Communications announcing the intention to prohibit smoking altogether began circulating, including letters and notices to staff. One of the administrators, Phillip Scott, assembled a task force—called the Smoke-Free Facilities Task Force—that aimed to develop and coordinate the new policy. The task force invited participation from different departments and from unions, including Union 789. Alex Johnson, the union’s president, did not personally attend the meetings but asked a union steward, Karen Martin, to participate. Karen Martin received agenda materials and draft policy statements that referenced a comprehensive ban on smoking indoors.

 In March, union presidents, including Alex Johnson, were invited to what was labeled as a courtesy meeting about the finalized no-smoking policy, which would forbid any smoking inside the employer’s facilities. During or shortly after that meeting, Johnson contacted Robert Morgan, a senior executive at Cypress Healthcare Co., by letter to propose bargaining over the policy. The new ban went into effect around the time Johnson’s letter was received. Johnson sought further clarification, and Union 789 eventually filed an unfair labor practice charge, asserting that Cypress Healthcare Co. had not met its obligation to bargain over a mandatory subject of employment.

 Cypress Healthcare Co. relies on provisions under the National Labor Relations Act that require a union, once put on notice of a policy change, to make a timely and explicit demand for bargaining. Citing precedent such as Henry Vogt Mach. Co. and certain Board rulings, Cypress Healthcare Co. contends it communicated its intentions early through draft policies sent to the task force and that Union 789 knew a total ban was coming but did not promptly demand negotiations until just before the changes took effect. Cypress Healthcare Co. also points out that similar restrictions had previously been enacted without objection, believing it had the prerogative to regulate employee conduct in this sphere so long as it did not violate collective bargaining requirements. Cypress Healthcare Co. interprets Board precedent to mean that a union’s delay in formally requesting negotiations after clear notice can amount to a waiver of the right to bargain, emphasizing that the union’s representative served on the task force and thereby became aware of the planned no-smoking ban in sufficient time to negotiate.

 Union 789 invokes the principle that employee smoking policies, especially those that prohibit or limit the practice entirely, are mandatory subjects of bargaining under precedents such as S.S. Kresge Co. v. NLRB. The union contends that, under the National Labor Relations Act, Cypress Healthcare Co. was required to present a definitive policy proposal and provide an opportunity for genuine negotiations before implementation. The union asserts it did not receive a clear, unequivocal proposal of a complete ban until late March, believing earlier indications signaled only a discussion forum rather than a final policy. Union 789 claims the employer’s creation of an ad hoc group to draft the policy delayed any formal announcement of specific changes, so the union was justified in expecting that the details remained unsettled. Thus, it argues that it did not waive its right to bargain and took timely action once it understood that Cypress Healthcare Co. planned to institute a total ban.
