You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alpha Manufacturing, Inc. hired Sam Brown to work as a machinist under a 90-day probationary period. As part of the application process, Alpha Manufacturing, Inc. required prospective employees to disclose all past full-time and part-time employment. Sam Brown did not reveal that he had worked briefly for Beta Machining, Inc. and had been dismissed for poor performance.

 Several months after Sam Brown began working, he disclosed a medical condition requiring surgery. The cost of this procedure would have been covered by Alpha Manufacturing, Inc.’s employee benefit plan. Soon thereafter, Sam Brown's employment ended, and he alleged that the termination was motivated by a desire to avoid covering his medical expenses. He claimed this constituted prohibited discrimination under ERISA as well as the Missouri Human Rights Act.

 During legal proceedings, Alpha Manufacturing, Inc. became aware that Sam Brown had intentionally failed to disclose his prior short-term employment and subsequent firing at Beta Machining, Inc. Alpha Manufacturing, Inc. asserted that it would not have employed Sam Brown, or would have dismissed him, had it known of his earlier misrepresentation. Sam Brown countered that the omitted information was not a crucial disqualification for the job, and that only facts actually known at the time of the discharge could properly form the basis for an employer’s motive. He further argued that an employer should not be encouraged to search after-the-fact for reasons to legitimize a potentially unlawful termination.

 In support of Alpha Manufacturing, Inc. prevailing, some arguments emphasize that after-acquired evidence of serious employee misrepresentation can bar recovery because an individual who failed to disclose essential information on an application should not gain from that omission. Citing the logic of opinions like Summers v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, these arguments contend that when an employer can demonstrate it would never have hired—or would have promptly discharged—an employee had it known the true facts, the employee is in no worse position than if the misrepresentation had been discovered initially. Such arguments highlight the importance of deterring deceptive practices on job applications and suggest that a claimant cannot seek redress for a discharge that would inevitably have occurred anyway under a legitimate no-hire or immediate-fire policy. Various courts, including those referencing Dotson v. United States Postal Serv., Washington v. Lake County, and Johnson v. Honeywell Information Sys., have recognized the principle that an employee’s false statements regarding qualifications or prior terminations overlay the question of proper legal relief.

 Conversely, in support of Sam Brown prevailing, some arguments rely on reasoning exemplified by Wallace v. Dunn Const. Co., which stresses that the primary purposes of ERISA and the Missouri Human Rights Act include deterring unlawful discrimination and compensating victims of such conduct. Under this view, an employer’s discovery of previous deception does not wipe out liability for a wrongful act it may have committed with a discriminatory motive. The fact that the employer was unaware of the misrepresentation at the time of termination means it did not factor into or justify the firing decision then, and so should not be used after the fact to thwart an employee’s claim. These arguments caution that allowing after-acquired evidence to defeat recovery entirely would create a moral hazard by encouraging employers to comb through an employee’s history post-termination to uncover any error or omission that might shield the employer from accountability. Moreover, they assert that even if the employee’s application contained inaccuracies, the employer cannot retroactively remove liability by substituting a reason that was unknown at the time of discharge.
