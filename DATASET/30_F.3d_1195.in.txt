You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In Greenboro, California, a person wearing a cap and dark sunglasses entered Maple Trust Bank and spoke to teller Carla Munoz. The individual reportedly asked for money in both English and Spanish. Munoz hesitated, and the individual repeated the demand before asking her to hurry. After receiving currency from Munoz, the individual left the bank.

 Both Munoz and a second teller described the culprit to the FBI as a 5’5" individual with a moustache and a missing tooth. Photographs were shown, and Munoz identified Michael Ramirez as the suspect. A live lineup was later held, during which Munoz and the second teller again identified Michael Ramirez as the person who had committed the robbery.

 The Government filed charges under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). At trial, Munoz recounted what the robber had said and noted that the robber’s speech featured a noticeable slur or lisp. The Government then called Michael Ramirez to the front of the jury and required him to recite the exact words allegedly used during the robbery. Although Michael Ramirez had invoked his right not to testify, the court directed him to repeat the demanded statements. The Government did not further question Munoz about that demonstration, but Michael Ramirez’s counsel later made reference to the absence of any notable lisp in his voice.

 Michael Ramirez’s position emphasizes the principle that compelled demonstrations at trial might undercut a fundamental presumption of innocence. He relies on precedents discussing practices that could risk prejudicing a jury’s perception of a defendant, referencing, for instance, reasoning in cases such as Estelle v. Williams and Holbrook v. Flynn. He underscores that having to recite the exact words used in a crime can create a powerful association in jurors’ minds between himself and the alleged wrongdoing, especially where the demonstration is not distinctly or transparently presented as being for identification purposes alone. Citing Pennsylvania v. Muniz and United States v. Wade, he contends that while physical or vocal demonstrations might often survive scrutiny if clearly tied to legitimate evidentiary needs, the manner in which this demonstration was conducted could have undermined his due process rights.

 The Government’s position accents the notion that requesting a defendant to speak specific phrases does not encroach on the privilege against self-incrimination because such speech is a non-testimonial display of a physical characteristic. It draws support from United States v. Wade and Pennsylvania v. Muniz for the idea that voice exemplars, even those duplicating a crime’s language, remain permissible as an identification tool. The Government further insists that an in-court demonstration of words is not tantamount to a full reenactment of the offense. Rather, its purpose is to enable the jury or witness to confirm or refute a match in vocal traits. It also points out that a demonstration can afford a defendant an opportunity to rebut the claim of any distinctive speech pattern, suggesting that any influence on the jury is minimized by proper instructions and the general understanding that such demonstrations are a routine part of identification procedures.
