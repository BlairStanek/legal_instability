You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Warren White was charged with mail fraud and wire fraud after submitting a claim asserting that his red 1987 Dallimore pick-up truck was stolen in Summerview. According to the Government’s account, Warren White informed a representative from Riverside Insurance Company (RIC) by telephone that his vehicle had disappeared. The Government maintains that White mailed finished claim forms shortly afterward, prompting RIC to send payment for the loss. Nearly eighteen months later, investigators from the Missouri State Highway Patrol located a red 1987 Dallimore pick-up truck at Alex Jackson’s property in Silco Springs. This truck appeared to be the same one described in the insurance claim.

 The Government further alleges that Warren White maintained possession of the 1987 Dallimore truck after telling RIC it was stolen. Witnesses recounted that White drove this red Dallimore truck intermittently, storing it in a locked facility on Jackson’s land where White had access. Investigators reported that the original engine had been removed, and a Dalen diesel engine was suspended in front of the truck, with multiple switched or altered parts found around the storage area. A license plate associated with a blue 1979 Dallimore pick-up truck—later identified as the “Tomlin farm truck” and credited to White—was purportedly used on this 1987 Dallimore truck. The Government contends that various vehicles had their identifying marks changed to obscure their origins.

 Additional trucks—reportedly stolen from different dealerships—were discovered at the same property. The Government introduced evidence suggesting that Warren White enlisted others to help him acquire or conceal several of these vehicles, sometimes swapping engines and components among them. The Government also pointed to the Tomlin farm truck, which allegedly shared identifying symbols or parts with the red 1987 Dallimore truck. In sentencing proceedings, the Government asserted that the thefts of these other trucks served as relevant conduct because certain parts were interchanged with the 1987 Dallimore truck so it could remain in White’s ongoing use or remain concealed.

 In support of its position that White’s actions violated the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes, the Government asserts that the creation of any “scheme or artifice to defraud” under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343 reached beyond the initial insurance claim. It argues that White’s intent to defraud is evidenced by specific actions: reporting a theft that never occurred, profiting from a claim paid by RIC, and continuing to possess the truck. The Government contends that federal rules of evidence permit the introduction of conduct surrounding other altered vehicles and the Tomlin farm truck to show White’s plan, motive, or absence of mistake. The Government also invokes past precedents holding that evidence of switched parts, changed identification numbers, or related vehicle concealment can serve to prove an element of intent to defraud. Finally, it emphasizes that broad sentencing guidelines allow consideration of all direct or relevant acts—especially if they are part of a continuing course of conduct—when determining the loss amount, potential enhancements for planning, or classification of the defendant’s role.

 Warren White, on the other hand, stresses that while he completed insurance paperwork and received payment, those steps alone do not confirm intent to commit fraud. He claims that no genuine proof connects him definitively to the red Dallimore truck after its supposed theft, arguing that investigators relied on testimony from accomplices whose credibility he challenges. He disputes the Government’s depiction of the extended timeline, pointing out lengthy gaps and a lack of an unbroken pattern tying all alleged acts to his conduct surrounding the insurance claim. White maintains that any additional vehicle thefts—if they occurred—should not be used to show a plan or scheme tied to his insurance documents because they involved unrelated actors, emerged long after the reported theft of his truck, and were allegedly committed with different objectives. White also cites legal precedents limiting how far reaching the notion of “relevant conduct” can be, contending that the Government’s theory inappropriately stretches the connection between these incidents and the original claim in an effort to inflate both culpability and potential penalties.
