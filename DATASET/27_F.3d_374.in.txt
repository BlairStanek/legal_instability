You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1989, Canyon Hospitality Partnerships—which themselves comprise three related limited partnerships—entered into loan agreements with a financial institution later assigning its rights to Redwood Assurance, Inc. The total amount borrowed was approximately $41 million. The partnerships operated hotels located in Riverfields, Pinecrest, and Ridgeview District. The partnerships made loan payments until late 1990, and, in early 1991, they filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. Despite the bankruptcy filings, the partnerships continued operating their hotels. Several months later, Redwood Assurance, Inc. sought to ensure that the revenues generated by these hotels would remain segregated or otherwise protected, asserting a prior security interest in that revenue stream.

 When Redwood Assurance, Inc. requested from the bankruptcy court adequate protection or segregation of the hotels’ ongoing income, the court rejected that request, ruling that the existing circumstances did not justify imposing such protections. By the time the lender later foreclosed on the hotel properties, roughly $700,000 in net post-petition operational revenues from the three hotels had accumulated. These funds became the focus of the ongoing dispute.

 The partnerships and Redwood Assurance, Inc. advanced divergent views on whether the charges for room occupancy are properly categorized as “rent” for purposes of a creditor’s security interest under applicable law. Historical California authorities sometimes refer to hotel revenues or “room rent,” yet separate statutes distinguish hotel guests from tenants. The parties also debated whether, if these occupancy payments were considered rent, any portion of the overall hotel operations (including food and beverage services) should be treated differently—and whether a single law should unify the entire question of a lender’s secured interest in post-petition hotel receipts.

 Redwood Assurance, Inc. emphasizes that its loan documents explicitly granted a security interest in all revenues generated by hotel operations. Its position invokes the principle that, under federal bankruptcy statutes, certain post-petition revenues may remain subject to a pre-petition security agreement, especially if they constitute “rents, profits, or proceeds” of the secured property. Redwood Assurance, Inc. points to legal precedents clarifying that, to the extent occupancy payments arise from use of real property and are thus “produced by the property,” they should be protected as rents. Redwood Assurance, Inc. highlights longstanding commercial practice in the hotel industry, where lenders rely on revenues from room charges as part of their collateral. It also invokes decisions interpreting state law in contexts that arguably classify hotel room charges in the same manner as rents and relies on the notion that upholding the validity of a bargained-for security interest encourages capital investment and stability in large-scale real property financing.

 Canyon Hospitality Partnerships contends that under state statutes, hotel guests are not traditional tenants, and therefore charges for hotel rooms should be deemed more akin to accounts receivable than real property rents. They note that hotel guests have only transient rights, typically described as a simple license to use the premises, which differs from a tenant’s interest in real property. Canyon Hospitality Partnerships argues that, particularly in a bankruptcy context, categorizing room charges as rents improperly deprives the estate of funds that should be available to pay a broader range of creditors. They further cite state statutes referring to hotel charges as daily rates rather than rents. Finally, they maintain that when considering the business as a whole, the services provided—like food and beverage—constitute a significant portion of revenues, underscoring an argument that such income is not inherently tied to the real property but rather reflects operational or service-based receipts outside the scope of a real-property rent concept.
