You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Evelyn Watson had been working in a civilian position at the Department of the Army, which required a security clearance. She experienced mental health challenges over several years, including multiple hospitalizations, and sometimes stopped taking her prescribed medication. The Department grew concerned about whether her actions might affect her reliability. When additional manic symptoms appeared and she again discontinued medication, her clearance came under scrutiny. Her supervisor, Colonel Reid, initially supported reinstatement of her clearance after an earlier episode, but later recommended its revocation after concluding her judgment was in question. Evelyn Watson submitted a psychiatric evaluation from Dr. Martin Lane in her defense, stating that she was willing to remain on medication and posed no security threat.

 In the course of the clearance revocation process under Army Regulation 380-67, Evelyn Watson received a formal letter stating the grounds for the potential revocation. She was told she could respond, which she did personally and through counsel, disputing that her mental health condition justified any security risk. The Department reviewed records of her hospitalizations, her history of discontinuing medication, and opinions from agency psychiatrists. Commander Ross ultimately issued a decision that her clearance would be revoked for a set duration, citing concerns about reliability and judgment. Evelyn Watson asked for reconsideration and then pursued the matter through additional review within the Department.

 Evelyn Watson argued that she was not fairly notified of certain discussions among agency medical personnel, documented in internal memoranda, until after she filed Freedom of Information requests. She stated she should have been afforded a chance to address the points in those memoranda and to cross-examine the doctors involved. She maintained that she was deprived of the proper procedural safeguards required by Army Regulation 380-67. She also argued it was unreasonable to remove her if she could have been placed in a position not requiring a clearance, and that her accommodation requests were not properly considered. After her clearance was formally revoked, the Department ended her employment.

 In support of the Department of the Army, legal arguments emphasized that the agency properly followed all steps required by 5 U.S.C. § 7513(b) for giving advance notice, offering an opportunity to respond, allowing representation, and issuing a written decision. These arguments cited Department of the Navy v. Egan for the principle that a decision to grant or deny security clearance lies within executive discretion and is generally not subject to substantive review by an administrative body. The Department argued that the central concern was whether Evelyn Watson’s choice to discontinue medication—given her critical duties—demonstrated unreliability, which justified a revocation to protect national security. They pointed out that Army Regulation 380-67 only required sufficient notice of the adverse information and a chance to respond, asserting that these requirements were fully met. They also maintained that final consultations within the Department, including discussions with psychiatrists, were internal assessments of existing evidence, not new evidence requiring another round of responses.

 In support of Evelyn Watson, legal arguments highlighted that an agency must adhere to its own regulations, citing cases such as Service v. Dulles and Vitarelli v. Seaton for the principle that regulations governing adverse actions have binding force. She contended that the Department did not fully comply with Army Regulation 380-67, specifically by withholding certain internal memoranda that contained the medical reasoning justifying revocation. She argued she should have been allowed to address or rebut this evidence before the decision was made. She also invoked the requirement of providing specific reasons under 5 U.S.C. § 7513(b), asserting that she was not adequately informed of the detailed medical basis against her. Additionally, she observed that the regulation mandated thorough procedures to ensure fairness, and that a less severe option, such as reassignment, should have been explored before taking the step of revoking her clearance and ending her employment.
