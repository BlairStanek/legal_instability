You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Timothy Evans was employed as a pipe fitter by Clark Constructors, Inc. to work on a power plant at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, located in Seabridge, Virginia. During this construction job, Evans injured his left hand and suffered a permanent partial disability to one finger. He notified Clark Constructors, Inc. of his injury and sought disability benefits. 

 Clark Constructors, Inc. provided him with compensation under Virginia’s state workers’ compensation program but declined to provide benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA). Evans believed that his work on the shipyard’s power plant qualified as maritime employment, thereby entitling him to coverage under the federal scheme. Clark Constructors, Inc. took the opposite view, maintaining that building a power plant did not meet the Act’s requirements for maritime work.

 Evans asserted that the power plant was intended to generate electricity and steam primarily for use in shipbuilding and ship-repair operations at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, though some surplus electricity could be sold commercially. Clark Constructors, Inc. countered that constructing a facility—even if it would later be used in connection with ships—did not place Evans’s job duties within the scope of maritime employment, since he never directly worked on loading, unloading, or repairing vessels.

 Advocates for Clark Constructors, Inc. point to the language and structure of the LHWCA, especially 33 U.S.C. § 902(3), arguing that Congress required a distinct maritime status in addition to the location of the work. They emphasize that the LHWCA originally limited coverage to injuries on navigable waters and was later expanded to include adjacent facilities only if the injured person was engaged in maritime employment. They rely on precedents like Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. Schwalb, reading them to establish that an activity must be integral or essential to vessel-related operations such as loading, unloading, building, or repairing ships. According to Clark Constructors, Inc., merely constructing a shore-side power plant—even if it is eventually used to support shipyard operations—does not amount to the integral maritime activity described in such cases. They further contend that Congress’s inclusion of specific occupations (e.g., shipbuilders, ship repairers) indicates an intent to limit coverage to tasks inherently tied to vessels and navigation, rather than any and all work done at a shipyard.

 Advocates for Timothy Evans invoke the LHWCA’s broad remedial purpose and note that 33 U.S.C. § 902(3) is meant to be viewed expansively to protect workers who support shipbuilding and ship repair in any necessary way. They maintain that the Supreme Court has often held that indirect but essential activities can qualify as maritime employment. They cite cases emphasizing that equipment or infrastructure critical to continued vessel-related work can bring a task within the Act’s coverage. They argue that, just as maintaining or repairing essential shipyard machinery has been deemed indispensable to loading or unloading processes, constructing a power plant fundamental to running the shipyard’s equipment is similarly indispensable. Therefore, they contend, Evans’s role in building that crucial infrastructure meets the condition of being integral to shipbuilding and ship-repair operations.
