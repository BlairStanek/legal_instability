You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Greene spent roughly two decades employed in coal mining, primarily as a mine electrician. His work involved repairing electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical equipment in cramped and dusty mine conditions. He routinely lifted, carried, knelt, and crawled while performing these repairs. He later shifted to federal mine inspection work, eventually supervising office staff and several inspectors. His inspection duties required him to go underground on occasion, at times entering low coal, climbing ladders, and carrying various pieces of safety and testing equipment. He applied for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, claiming that his pneumoconiosis and increased difficulty breathing should entitle him to compensation.

 While working in private coal mining, Greene testified that he frequently undertook strenuous tasks in poor air quality, sometimes needing to move or replace very heavy machinery and motors. He stated that extended hours in dusty areas posed significant challenges, particularly when equipment breakdowns forced him into high-exposure parts of the mine for lengthy periods. In contrast, as a federal mine inspection supervisor, Greene oversaw the safety-related responsibilities of inspectors and performed administrative tasks, with only occasional underground visits that still sometimes required partial crawling or humid, dusty exposure. Greene contended that these brief forays underground were nowhere near as physically demanding as his former duties as a mine electrician.

 Greene’s benefit claim led to a fact-finding hearing. He argued that, despite remaining in mine-related work, his present supervisory position differed markedly from a mine electrician’s duties, both in degree of exertion and dust exposure. Other evidence pointed to overlap in knowledge and tasks: in both positions he handled equipment, dealt with underground conditions, and possessed specialized training, though each role required him to perform these responsibilities to varying extents. At issue was whether Greene’s current job was sufficiently comparable to his previous mining work to disqualify him from showing total disability under 20 C.F.R. § 727.203(b)(1).

 Advocates for the Director, Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs rely primarily on the argument that the statutory and regulatory framework, including 30 U.S.C. § 901 et seq. and 20 C.F.R. § 727.203(b)(1), allows a broad inquiry into whether a miner’s post-mine role is “comparable and gainful.” They cite Ratliff v. Benefits Review Bd. and Echo v. Director, Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs to show that comparability may encompass the continuation of specialized knowledge, occasional physical exertion, and compensation that indicates the individual is, in effect, still engaged in compatible work. Under precedents like Big Horn Coal Co. v. Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs and Pate v. Director, Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, it can be argued that a range of factors—technical expertise, physical requirements, salary, and occupational responsibilities—helps determine if someone is truly disabled or whether he is simply performing a lateral shift into an occupation calling for overlapping abilities. From this perspective, going underground even on a part-time basis, along with carrying essential safety gear and employing specialized mining insight, suggests a meaningful equivalence to former mining tasks. The Director’s position further invokes Richardson v. Perales to emphasize that deference should be accorded to fact-finders who weigh the record evidence about a person’s exertional abilities and the nature of the job activities.

 On the other side, Greene’s position is that he must establish total disability under the Black Lung Benefits Act even if he remains employed, provided the new role differs in ways indicating a significantly reduced capacity for his former mine work. Citing Ratliff v. Benefits Review Bd. and Echo v. Director, Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, he might stress that supervision of inspections in a sporadic underground environment does not approximate regular and intense physical demands, persistent crawling, dust inhalation, and protracted shifts in hazardous conditions that mine electricians face. He can argue that the real inquiry under 20 C.F.R. § 727.203(b)(1) should focus on whether one is still physically capable of sustaining the rigors of a typical mining position, particularly the more grueling aspects, such as manipulating heavy equipment in dusty, confined spaces. In Greene’s view, the occasional carrying of smaller implements during brief hallway-like checks underground cannot signify that he retains the same abilities as before. Citing 30 U.S.C. § 902(f)(1)(B)(ii) and the reasoning in cases like Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Benefits Review Bd., he would emphasize that continued employment alone should not be paramount; rather, diminished exertional capacity, altered location or conditions, and changes in job duties may together prove the necessary reduced ability to do what his past coal mine role required.
