You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Thomas Green served both as an attorney and as an elected representative of a union we will call the Union of Railway Operators. He once worked at a private law practice we will call the Robinson Law Firm. At the same time, he had ties to an attorney we will call Alan Martin. Green appeared before a grand jury to testify about whether the Robinson Law Firm or Martin had paid certain union campaign and business costs for him. While testifying, Green denied receiving any such payments. Later, federal prosecutors found materials suggesting that payments may have occurred.

 The grand jury was originally looking into possible offenses involving the Robinson Law Firm’s support of Green’s union activities. Although one area of focus was a specific labor statute that restricts campaign contributions from employers, that particular statute carries no direct criminal penalties. Nonetheless, transcripts and filings showed that the grand jury inquiry also looked at possible mail fraud and Travel Act violations. Prosecutors theorized that if the Robinson Law Firm had reimbursed Green for certain activities in exchange for referrals of union members or promotion of the law firm, it might constitute a scheme implicating mail fraud or state-law bribery through interstate travel.

 As the proceedings moved forward, Green’s statements to the grand jury, denying any reimbursements, became the main issue. The documents entered into evidence included expense records, letters, and other notations that prosecutors said contradicted Green’s sworn testimony. Green was also called upon to produce various documents via subpoena, but disputes arose over what was turned over and what was not. Additionally, in the courtroom, government counsel, here renamed Daniel Evans, argued that Green’s lack of document production and his prior statements were connected, suggesting concealment.

 In support of The Government, it was argued that Green’s testimony about not receiving reimbursements was pivotal for investigating mail fraud and Travel Act questions. The Government highlighted that, under certain readings of federal mail fraud law and its added clause on intangible rights, concealing payments could be part of a deceptive scheme. They also stressed that the Travel Act’s inclusion of state-law bribery as a predicate offense gave the grand jury a broad basis to inquire about any alleged bribes. The Government presented Green’s letters to the Robinson Law Firm and expense submissions as proof that such payments existed. According to this line of reasoning, if Green knew these payments were improper within the labor context, it showed his motivation to minimize exposure and lie under oath. By connecting the documents to the timeline, The Government argued that even if certain statutes took effect later, any possibility of wrongdoing under earlier or subsequent sets of facts made Green’s statements to the grand jury material to its investigation.

 On behalf of Thomas Green, it was argued that referencing a labor regulation without criminal or civil penalties was too insubstantial to establish a genuine motive to lie. The suggestion that Green could have covered up those expenses out of fear of violating a federal statute, it was contended, did not make sense if the statute carried no meaningful sanctions. Green’s side also challenged the logic of tying his testimony to broader federal crimes, noting that no actual charges for those offenses arose from this scenario. They further argued that certain inferences the Government asked the jury to draw were speculative—especially suggestions that he deliberately withheld documents. From this perspective, the lack of clarity about when and how he supposedly came to know the labor law—plus the relatively low risk of any real penalty—would not rationally lead to a false statement before the grand jury. Moreover, his side challenged the jury instructions that mentioned it was “improper” for employers to fund such union activities, characterizing them as conflating immaterial statutory language with the suggestion of a serious violation, thus creating an unwarranted inference of criminal intent.
