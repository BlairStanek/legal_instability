You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Bob Smith was an attorney and businessman who maintained an account at Harbin Bank & Trust in Connecticut. He wrote a check for a substantial sum payable to Lakeview Clearing Co., which was associated with Roberts & Co. Brokerage, the firm handling certain bond purchases for him. At the time he issued this check, he allegedly had insufficient funds in the account. Shortly thereafter, Bob Smith prepared another check from his personal account at Hilltop Bank and deposited it into his account at Harbin Bank & Trust, also allegedly against insufficient funds. Meanwhile, Bob Smith contacted Kelly Johnson, who was serving as an interim manager of a Harbin Bank & Trust branch in Millhaven, about covering the first check.

 Kelly Johnson later authorized payment of Bob Smith’s check even though, according to banking records, the account did not contain enough cleared funds to cover it. There was testimony that Bob Smith cited a pending wire transfer that would replenish his account. Kelly Johnson claimed he specifically requested payment, while Bob Smith was reported to have described the request as a hold action, rather than immediate payment. Following these transactions, Bob Smith also wrote checks from his account at Mapleton Bank, twice, which were likewise returned for insufficient funds. Harbin Bank & Trust was left as the only bank that had funded a large payment on Bob Smith’s behalf.

 Bob Smith spoke with multiple individuals at Harbin Bank & Trust after the payment and also with agents from the FBI. Various internal memoranda at Harbin Bank & Trust documented events relating to the check, its approval against unavailable funds, and subsequent charge-offs. Some descriptions in these internal documents appeared not to match Kelly Johnson’s recollection at trial, including whether Bob Smith explicitly requested payment of the check, whether she knew the deposited sum was a check rather than a wire, and the timing of her discovery of any discrepancies. Bob Smith never ultimately provided sufficient funds to Harbin Bank & Trust for the payment the bank had made.

 Bob Smith has presented arguments under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 and related authorities that revolve around whether he ever intended to cause any false representation to Harbin Bank & Trust. He contends that under Federal Rule of Evidence 613(b), any discrepancies in internal bank documents could impeach the recollections of bank employees who served as witnesses, suggesting that those employees acted independently or misapprehended the circumstances. He offers the view that business records, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), may reflect that the bank’s own procedures or misunderstandings—rather than his statements—led to the payment of the check despite insufficient funds. He further argues that, under cases such as United States v. Freidin, internal memoranda prepared in the routine course of a bank’s affairs should be admissible to clarify that no express request was made for payment, and that inferences drawn from any purportedly false exculpatory statements do not, by themselves, establish fraudulent intent.

 The Government has argued that Bob Smith’s actions, viewed collectively, show a scheme or artifice to defraud within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1344. It emphasizes that Federal Rule of Evidence 613(b) allows impeachment only if inconsistencies genuinely contradict a witness’s testimony, and notes that mere omissions or minor ambiguities may not overcome the evidence that Bob Smith explicitly assured the bank of incoming funds when none were actually provided. Citing precedents such as United States v. Scheibel, the Government emphasizes that multiple instances of apparently false exculpatory statements to bank officials and federal agents could be interpreted as proof of Bob Smith’s consciousness of guilt, in line with judicial precedent that gives such statements independent probative value. Finally, the Government maintains that even if portions of the bank’s internal memoranda were admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), this would not undermine the position that Bob Smith sought to induce payment knowing he lacked sufficient funds, an inference it contends is bolstered by multiple checks being returned for insufficient funds.
