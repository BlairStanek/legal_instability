You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Frontier-Sterling furnished building materials to Apex Interiors under arrangements that called for Apex Interiors to use those materials in completing drywall work on a residential construction project. Apex Interiors fell behind on its payments to Frontier-Sterling. As a result, Frontier-Sterling pursued legal action in a federal court and obtained a judgment against Apex Interiors for a significant sum. Frontier-Sterling then attempted to collect on its judgment by targeting money that Hanover Constructors Inc. purportedly owed to Apex Interiors under a construction contract.

 During the garnishment proceeding, Hanover Constructors Inc. acknowledged that it held funds meant for Apex Interiors but asserted it was entitled to reduce what it owed, pointing to added costs and attorney fees it claimed arose from Apex Interiors’ alleged failures. Frontier-Sterling agreed that Hanover Constructors Inc. could deduct a small portion for certain documented expenses but disputed the majority of the claimed setoffs. The disputed portion concerned whether Hanover Constructors Inc. could recoup pending legal and related costs purportedly incurred because Apex Interiors did not carry out all its obligations under their construction contract.

 The contract between Apex Interiors and Hanover Constructors Inc. contained an arbitration clause requiring that any disagreements arising from the contract be resolved in a non-court forum. Frontier-Sterling was not an original participant in that contract. Hanover Constructors Inc. insisted that the arbitration requirement controlled because Frontier-Sterling stood in the position of Apex Interiors for determining contract-related financial obligations. Frontier-Sterling, however, asserted that it had never assented to arbitrate any question and that it had a right to litigate the existence and amount of those funds under normal garnishment procedures.

 Those favoring Frontier-Sterling’s position articulate that traditional garnishment law permits a judgment creditor to pursue court-based remedies without taking on any contractual procedures that might apply to the judgment debtor. They rely on federal procedural rules that incorporate state garnishment practices, arguing that these rules entitle a creditor to collect on a judgment through court-directed proceedings. They also reference the notion that a non-party to a contract cannot typically be forced to arbitrate unless it explicitly assented to do so, emphasizing that arbitration clauses are binding only on those who consent. By highlighting how garnishment exists solely to remedy a debtor’s failure to pay, proponents of Frontier-Sterling’s view say that a creditor’s right to execute a judgment in court cannot be curtailed by an agreement the creditor never joined. They insist that fundamental principles of due process support their contention that a judgment creditor is free to contest the amount of the debtor’s property within a judicial setting.

 Those favoring Hanover Constructors Inc. respond that Frontier-Sterling effectively “steps into the shoes” of Apex Interiors for any dispute regarding the value of the contract. They argue that if a creditor invokes a contract to seize the amounts owed to the judgment debtor, then the creditor must also abide by the terms of that contract, including any arbitration provision. They point to language in established garnishment authorities indicating that a garnishment does not create new rights but only permits a creditor to stand in the debtor’s place for purposes of collecting contractual benefits. They assert that arbitration clauses are vital procedural rights that form part of the overall bargain between the contracting parties, and that removing the right of arbitration when the creditor pursues garnishment unfairly strips the garnishee of a negotiated benefit. Proponents of this view claim that, absent a requirement of arbitration, a garnishee is left with a forum not of its choosing, despite the clear contractual language agreeing to arbitrate all issues related to performance, payments, and setoffs.
