You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A.S. was a juvenile who, while driving a car, struck and killed a jogger on a roadway in the Redwood Archipelago. The view along the road where the incident occurred was not obstructed. Following the incident, the Redwood Archipelago Government pursued charges against A.S. for negligent homicide and negligent driving. A.S. acknowledged responsibility for negligent homicide, and the other charge was dismissed. A.S. was later brought before the family division of the lower court for a disposition hearing. At that hearing, the presiding judge stated an intention to impose multiple conditions on A.S., including a fine, and sought written arguments on the issue. No prior juvenile case there had involved a monetary penalty.

 After receiving limited briefing, the lower court placed A.S. on probation, required performance of community service, and imposed a fine. A.S. then challenged the ability of the court to levy that fine, asserting that the relevant juvenile statutes in the Redwood Archipelago’s code did not authorize monetary sanctions. In addition, A.S. described the penalty as implicating constitutional constraints against implementing new punishments after an offense had occurred. An intermediate court later reviewed the same arguments and endorsed the lower court’s reading of the statutes, concluding that broad language regarding sanctions allowed a fine.

 In separate arguments, references were made to the fact that A.S., despite being a juvenile, engaged in a typically adult activity—driving—and that a person lost his life as a result. It was emphasized that the sanction might serve the recognized purpose of demonstrating the gravity of operating a vehicle negligently. It was also noted that, although the legislated provisions detailed multiple conditions of probation—such as community service or placement in a facility—there was a question whether a monetary penalty was within the scope of existing law. At the same time, the notion of flexibility in juvenile dispositions, especially where statutes reference conditions “appropriate to the seriousness of the offense,” was used to support imposing a fine.

 On A.S.’s behalf, it was argued at length that the applicable sections of the Redwood Archipelago’s juvenile code contained an exhaustive set of permissible sanctions, all of which either involved care, treatment, or various forms of supervision. According to this view, the code’s language never expressly included a fine, and the catchall reference to “other lawful conditions” was interpreted to address non-monetary requirements regulating behavior. Proponents of this position emphasized that juveniles should have fair notice of potential penalties, and that the legislative text never indicated juveniles could face a monetary penalty. An additional constitutional argument was offered, suggesting that adding a new kind of punishment without longstanding precedent amounted to an impermissible expansion of punitive measures after the fact.

 On behalf of the Redwood Archipelago Government, it was argued—with equal strength—that the juvenile code permitted imposing a range of sanctions consistent with both rehabilitation and deterrence. In that view, the code’s references to “appropriate” sanctions included a fine, especially in light of a catchall provision that stated “other lawful conditions” might be imposed. Advocates of this reasoning pointed out that setting a fixed sum for a fine could mirror how adult cases operate, involving statutory monetary penalties. They contended that there had been enough general notice in the law’s broad language to encompass financial punishments, and that such penalties were an ordinary tool in many other jurisdictions for underscoring the gravity of a delinquent act—particularly one resulting in a loss of life. They also noted that the code specifically contemplates flexibility, allowing judges to shape dispositions that would foster a juvenile’s development and sense of responsibility.
