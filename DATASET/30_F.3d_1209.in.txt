You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Gary Goodwin holds a state court judgment against Fred Watson, arising from a remodeling job at a restaurant. After the remodeling was finished, they had a dispute over payment, and Gary Goodwin sued. Fred Watson later filed a Chapter 11 petition, listing Gary Goodwin as a large unsecured creditor. In the plan under consideration, Fred Watson grouped Gary Goodwin with other unsecured creditors and proposed repayment over an extended period. Only Gary Goodwin voted against this proposal, creating a dispute about whether the plan could be approved despite objections from his entire class.

 Fred Watson earns income by buying, renovating, and selling real estate, as well as operating two franchises called Harrison’s Tacos (renamed). In the course of the bankruptcy process, Fred Watson initially proposed two plans of reorganization that did not gain approval. On the third attempt, certain creditors in the same class as Gary Goodwin supported the plan, but Gary Goodwin objected, asserting that the plan unfairly delayed or reduced his right to full payment. The plan contemplated paying unsecured creditors the nominal value of their claims over sixty-seven months, without specifying interest.

 The arguments surrounding the plan involved whether the proposal to repay Gary Goodwin’s class without interest violated any statutory requirement. Questions also arose as to whether Fred Watson had provided sufficiently detailed disclosures about his financial state and the plan’s feasibility, so that creditors could evaluate the proposal. Additionally, the dispute concerned whether a five-year limit for repayment schedules found in section 1322(c) of the Bankruptcy Code might apply. Parts of the plan also contemplated Fred Watson retaining ownership or control of assets during and after the plan.

 Those supporting Gary Goodwin contend that the repayment schedule, which stretches beyond five years and omits interest, raises concerns under 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(B). They say that the code’s “fair and equitable” requirement means the unsecured class must receive payment that accounts for the present value of its claims, which includes an interest component over any extended repayment timeline. They also argue that Fred Watson’s plan must fully align with the absolute priority rule, a principle they interpret to prohibit a debtor from retaining equity or business assets unless objecting creditors are paid in a way that reflects the current worth of their claims. Citing cases like In re Johnston, In re Camino Real Landscape Maintenance Contractors, Inc., and United Sav. Ass’n v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., supporters of Gary Goodwin emphasize that any proposed reorganization should compensate unsecured creditors for the lost time value of money. They further assert that questionable or incomplete disclosures regarding Fred Watson’s assets and operations could have skewed the voting process among other creditors, depriving those creditors of a meaningful chance to assess the plan’s true value and feasibility.

 Those supporting Fred Watson contend that the proposed repayment plan satisfies all statutory conditions, emphasizing that it pays Gary Goodwin’s class the full nominal amount of their claims over time. They argue that 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(B) does not necessarily mandate explicit interest payments if the overall payment structure can be viewed as equitable when measured against the allowed claims. Referencing the flexibility in Chapter 11 reorganizations, they assert the debtor can preserve control of assets and continue operating a business if creditors receive all that is allowed in the final claims. They further maintain that section 1322(c)’s five-year limit applies only to Chapter 13 cases, and not to Chapter 11. Concerning disclosures, supporters of Fred Watson emphasize that earlier documents and hearings provided creditors with ample financial information, and they contend this disclosure allowed every impacted party to make a fully informed decision about supporting or objecting to the plan.
