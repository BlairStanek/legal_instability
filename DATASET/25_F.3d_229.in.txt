You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The Public Treasury Staff Union, recognized to represent certain employees, presented four proposals related to investigatory interviews conducted by the Office of Inspector General at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These proposals addressed employee representation rights and specific advisories for situations that might involve possible criminal or disciplinary investigations. When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declined to negotiate, stating concerns about Inspector General independence, the matter proceeded for administrative review.

 During this process, the Federal Labor Relations Authority determined that the four proposals could be suitable topics for collective bargaining. The proposals included provisions for clarifying questions and answers during interviews, notifying employees of the general nature of inquiries, and providing specific warnings in cases involving possible criminal wrongdoing or where prosecution had been declined. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission took the position that such provisions could improperly constrain the Office of Inspector General within the agency.

 The dispute centered on whether, under relevant federal labor law, an agency must negotiate over matters that might affect the manner and substance of Inspector General investigations. The Public Treasury Staff Union maintained that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute allowed negotiation on conditions of employment, including interview procedures, so long as statutory rights of agency employees are respected. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, believed that the Inspector General Act provides the Office of Inspector General autonomy that would be undermined by entering into contractual obligations on how interviews are conducted.

 Arguments supporting the first party (the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) highlight that the Inspector General Act was designed to ensure independent audits and investigations and shield the Office of Inspector General from constraints imposed by the very agency it investigates. Under this view, collective bargaining agreements that prescribe interview protocols could interfere with the Inspector General’s discretion to determine methods and timing of investigative steps. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission emphasizes statutory language ensuring investigators have broad latitude to prevent fraud, mismanagement, or wrongdoing. It also notes legislative history emphasizing that no part of the agency—beyond the head or one deputy—may supervise investigations, suggesting that binding agreements on interview procedures might in effect supervise or limit Inspector General functions. According to these arguments, the provisions of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute must be interpreted in harmony with the Inspector General Act’s purpose of ensuring robust, unbiased investigations. The Commission further contends that allowing negotiation on these subjects would lead to potential conflicts with the Inspector General Act’s requirement that the Office of Inspector General operate without interference or undue pressure.

 Arguments in favor of the second party (the Federal Labor Relations Authority) contend that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute grants employees the right to collective bargaining over conditions of employment, including how interviews may proceed. According to these arguments, bargaining does not necessarily violate Inspector General independence but instead can clarify employee rights that already exist under federal law. They emphasize that the Office of Inspector General remains under broad supervisory authority of the agency head in certain respects, permitting negotiation on employee-centric concerns so long as investigative integrity is not outright obstructed. Citing precedent indicating that investigations carried out by an Inspector General can still be subject to certain employee protections, the Federal Labor Relations Authority’s position is that there is room to craft provisions ensuring fairness to employees while preserving the Investigator General’s underlying fact-finding authority. In these arguments, the statutory exception for matters inconsistent with federal law is read narrowly, only barring provisions that explicitly prevent or prohibit investigations, rather than simply guiding procedures for interviews.
