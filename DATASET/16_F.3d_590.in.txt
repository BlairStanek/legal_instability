You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Mary Smith gave birth to Baby S at Riverside Health. Baby S was born with a severe congenital condition that prevented her from having any cognitive awareness or ability to interact with her environment. Soon after birth, medical staff at Riverside Health placed Baby S on a mechanical ventilator when she experienced breathing difficulties. Mary Smith wanted mechanical ventilation to continue whenever Baby S could not breathe on her own.

 The medical team at Riverside Health informed Mary Smith that most infants in Baby S’s condition do not survive long and that mechanical ventilation would not provide lasting improvement. The hospital sought to transfer Baby S to another facility, but no other regional facilities would accept her. After Baby S’s condition stabilized the first time, she was sent to the Walnut Grove Center, where she stayed until she again experienced breathing problems. On multiple occasions, Baby S returned to Riverside Health in respiratory distress, received mechanical ventilation, and then went back to the Walnut Grove Center.

 Eventually, Riverside Health started a legal action asking a court to declare that it was not obligated to provide mechanical ventilation to Baby S under various federal laws and under state law. Mary Smith disagreed and insisted on continued respiratory support whenever Baby S arrived with breathing difficulties. The father, John Smith, and a guardian became involved as well, taking a position consistent with Riverside Health’s request to discontinue mechanical ventilation. The legal dispute centered on whether Riverside Health’s obligations under federal laws governing emergency medical treatment required the hospital to provide mechanical ventilation to Baby S whenever she arrived with difficulty breathing.

 In support of Mary Smith’s position, it was argued that federal law—specifically, provisions of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act—unambiguously mandates participating facilities to furnish essential treatment for any patient who presents with an emergency medical condition. According to this view, whenever a patient’s condition threatens serious impairment or dysfunction, immediate stabilizing measures are required, and such measures necessarily include mechanical support if needed to ensure the patient’s breathing does not deteriorate. Proponents of Mary Smith’s position relied on statutory language defining “emergency medical condition” and argued that no exceptions exist based on the patient’s broader prognosis or quality of life. In their view, the straightforward reading of the law compels participating hospitals to use available staff and resources to prevent material deterioration, regardless of an individual’s long-term outlook or the ethical considerations of the care team.

 In support of Riverside Health’s position, it was argued that the relevant federal statutes, including those cited under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, were never intended to apply rigidly to every patient’s circumstances without some recognition of prevailing medical standards of care. The hospital’s perspective emphasized that the primary purpose behind these federal requirements was to prevent the “dumping” of patients unable to pay or lacking insurance, and that it was not meant to dictate that hospitals must provide interventions deemed medically or ethically inappropriate. The hospital also pointed to language in state law suggesting that physicians may refuse to administer treatment they judge futile or beyond the scope of sound practice. Furthermore, they contended that providing repeated mechanical ventilation for a condition that offers no hope of improvement goes against the statute’s core goal, as the federal law was designed to ensure fairness in emergency settings rather than to compel indefinite life support under all circumstances.
