You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. operates a distribution facility in Parkville, Pennsylvania. The facility’s warehouse workers have long been represented by Local Organization No. 45 of the Drivers, Warehouse Workers, and Helpers (the Association). After Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. assumed control of the facility from a prior operator, the Association and the company began negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, with the old agreement remaining in effect on an extended basis during negotiations. During these discussions, the parties became divided over the precise meaning of the “full-time” designation in the bargaining unit, especially regarding whether individuals working fewer than 40 hours per week were properly included.

 Two individuals employed as night loaders for over a year under the prior operator had never joined the Association, prompting the Association to question whether the phrase “only full-time plant employees” properly excluded employees regularly working less than 40 hours per week. Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. pointed out that the plain text of the old agreement expressly included only “full-time” workers and insisted that these night loaders had never been part of the bargaining unit. The Association countered that, historically, anyone who had completed a probationary period and worked regularly, regardless of total hours, was included in the bargaining unit. Amid confusion over the historical handling of part-time workers, the parties had ongoing bargaining sessions, with each side proposing language clarifying who counted as “full-time.” The Association expressed fears that the company might replace regular workers with part-time employees, while the company maintained that it was merely trying to conform to established contract language.

 When negotiations stalled on multiple points, Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. instituted a lockout of the warehouse employees, explaining that it was an economic measure designed to pressure the workforce to accept the company’s final proposals. During the ensuing discussions, the parties again addressed whether employees working fewer than 40 hours were part of the unit. At one point, Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. proposed explicitly including part-time individuals in the agreement, but the parties did not resolve all outstanding issues. The lockout continued, during which the company used temporary labor. The Association, for its part, contended that the company’s position regarding the coverage of part-time staff was impermissible and that the lockout was being used to force acceptance of this position.

 Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. offers several legal contentions under the National Labor Relations Act, notably emphasizing that the language of previous contracts limited the bargaining unit to “only full-time plant employees.” Given that no employee had historically challenged that language, the company views its proposals as simply clarifications, not a non-mandatory demand. The company points to the absence of any grievance concerning the two night loaders’ membership status, arguing that this practical course of dealing supports its interpretation. It also argues that an employer may use a lockout to apply legitimate economic pressure if the locked-out issues concern wages or other mandatory subjects. One of the cited authorities is American Ship Building Co. v. N.L.R.B., which the company views as allowing lockouts that are not aimed at forcing acceptance of an unlawful condition. The company further insists that, since recognizing part-time workers was never required by the older agreement’s terms, the proposal at issue involved no improper demand.

 The National Labor Relations Board asserts that the scope of a bargaining unit is a non-mandatory subject under precedents such as NLRB v. Wooster Div. of Borg-Warner Corp. and that it is unlawful to insist on including that subject as a firm prerequisite to finalizing an agreement. Because, in the Board’s view, Patton Soda Distributors, Inc. effectively proposed excluding part-time employees for the duration of any contract, the company was making acceptance of a non-mandatory subject a condition for a deal on matters like wages or benefits. The Board contends that even if “part-time” status was pending clarification, the actual effect was to change the unit’s historical composition. In turn, the Board believes this insistence on excluding a subset of regularly scheduled employees contravenes sections 8(a)(5), 8(b)(3), and 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act. Additionally, the Board views the lockout as a measure used to push the challenged position and thereby maintain pressure on the workforce to consent to excluding certain employees from coverage, rendering that lockout incompatible with lawful economic bargaining tactics.
