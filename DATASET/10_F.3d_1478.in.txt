You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Bayview Valley, Inc. once developed a mountain recreation facility near Cypress Bay. Its principal officer, Terry Brown, oversaw operations and had responsibility for employee withholding taxes. During a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bayview Valley, Inc. proposed to sell all real property and assets to Foggy Peak Ski Corporation. The sale agreement included potential future payments to Bayview Valley, Inc. if the buyer resold the property at a profit within five years or if downhill sporting activities occurred there within a ten-year window. Terry Brown stayed on, without salary, to manage details of the process, based on an informal understanding with the Lenders Consortium that his personal liability for certain taxes would be addressed through plan payments.

 The IRS filed a claim for unpaid taxes, including trust fund obligations that could expose Terry Brown to personal liability if they remained unpaid. An administrative mistake caused the amount declared in the plan for the IRS’s claims to be lower than the actual sum owed. Over time, the IRS received payments under the plan, which were initially believed to cover its entire claim. However, a shortfall surfaced, leaving a portion of the claim still outstanding. Terry Brown was informed that he could face personal liability for whatever remained of the trust fund taxes. Bayview Valley, Inc. then sought an order directing that plan payments to the IRS be allocated first to cover the trust fund portion, thereby preventing personal liability from attaching to Terry Brown.

 Bayview Valley, Inc. asserted that continuing payments under the plan depended on Terry Brown’s involvement, arguing that his expertise and contacts with Foggy Peak Ski Corporation and various agencies could maximize returns if the property became a viable downhill facility again. The IRS responded that all of Bayview Valley, Inc.’s significant assets had already been sold, characterizing the situation as a liquidation rather than an active reorganization. The IRS argued that any future success of the mountain facility was uncertain and that recalculating allocations would merely shield the corporate officer from personal tax liability without ensuring that the remaining taxes would ever be fully paid.

 In support of Bayview Valley, Inc., several arguments were presented. First, reference was made to precedent from Energy Resources Co., emphasizing that bankruptcy courts have authority to specify how tax payments should be applied if such directives were central to achieving Chapter 11’s goals. By allocating payments to the trust fund portion first, Bayview Valley, Inc. argued, the employer’s officer would remain motivated to devote time and effort to implementing the plan, which might yield additional funds if any stated contingencies triggered further payments. Second, Bayview Valley, Inc. maintained that the arrangement did not violate the Bankruptcy Code’s rules on tax claims, as it did not reduce the IRS’s overall entitlement but merely designated the order in which portions of the debt were credited. Third, Bayview Valley, Inc. argued that protecting the officer from personal liability was a practical step: his skills and familiarity with permits, local approvals, and business contacts were essential to any possibility of revitalizing the facility or generating extra revenue from subsequent transfers.

 In support of the IRS, arguments stressed that the real estate had been sold off and that Bayview Valley, Inc. had limited operations, effectively making this situation a straight liquidation rather than a continued business reorganization. The IRS pointed to Kelly v. Lethert and other authority suggesting that Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code holds responsible officers personally liable for unpaid trust fund taxes, and that courts should not allow reallocation purely to relieve such liability without ensuring full payment to the IRS. The IRS further contended that key provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including the six-year rule under Section 1129 and the absolute priority requirements, impose limits on rearranging tax priorities if the practical effect is to place the IRS in a riskier position for its remaining claim. Moreover, the IRS argued that no credible evidence linked the officer’s liability relief to any realistic possibility of future profits from the property’s sale or operations, as the plan’s contingencies were highly uncertain.
