You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Devon Ellis was imprisoned at Prairiefield Facility in Michigan and confined to administrative segregation. One day, Ellis broke a sprinkler in his cell, causing a flood. He was briefly placed in a quiet cell, then returned to his own cell, where he found his mattress soaked. He voiced complaints to correctional staff, including officer Casey Ivory and another officer, about the situation. Later, during approved exercise time, Ellis climbed onto a basketball goal in the segregation exercise area, continuing to protest about his wet mattress.

 While Ellis remained atop the basketball goal, prison staff instructed him to come down. They also consulted a superior to obtain permission to use a chemical agent if necessary. Before a psychologist ordered to the scene arrived, Ellis was subjected to the use of a chemical agent upon Ivory’s directive. In response, Ellis moved from the basketball goal to a razor-ribboned fence. A psychologist arrived and attempted to speak with Ellis; at the same time, other officers urged Ellis to descend. Ellis was then subjected to a chemical agent a second time. Eventually, staff physically removed him from the fence, and he was later treated for a cut on his foot.

 An investigation by the Michigan Department of Corrections found that Ivory had allegedly violated guidelines regarding when and how a chemical agent should be used. Ellis sued, claiming that this conduct violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment as excessive force and that a state policy directive created a protected liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment, which he argued had been infringed. Ivory responded by asserting a defense of immunity from suit, maintaining that the existing procedures were discretionary and that no constitutional violation had arisen from their use of force.

 In support of Ivory’s position, it is argued that the policy directive focuses on the discretionary judgment of prison staff, particularly in tense or emergent circumstances. Ivory’s supporters contend that certain legal precedents indicate prison officials must make swift decisions to ensure order and security, and that such guidelines are not intended to confer rigid, mandatory rights to inmates. They rely on language from precedents stating that prison administrators receive broad deference in matters of institutional security and that guidelines existing solely to assist officials should not be read to create substantive entitlements. They further argue that immunity from suit is essential so that officers facing potentially volatile situations are not deterred from carrying out their duties.

 In support of Ellis’s position, it is argued that the directive in question contains mandatory terms—such as procedures requiring consultation with medical staff, efforts to defuse the situation, and a warning before force is used—that create a clear, substantive right not to be subjected to chemical agents absent specified conditions. According to Ellis’s view, the officers failed to follow these steps, thereby violating his due process guarantee under the Fourteenth Amendment. Ellis’s supporters cite precedents emphasizing that mandatory rules or language can give rise to constitutionally protected interests and that the procedures established thereunder must be observed. They also point out that officers could have relied on less intrusive means to secure compliance, thus undermining any claim of urgent necessity justifying the repeated use of chemicals.
