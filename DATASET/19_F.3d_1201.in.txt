You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A federal emissions standard for benzene was established under the Clean Air Act, with an effective date for existing facilities. Riverwood Incorporated operated a monochlorobenzene manufacturing facility in Lakeville, Illinois. To meet the new limit, Riverwood requested more time from the Environmental Protection Agency and received an initial waiver allowing it to install control technology.

 After installation of a water scrubbing system designed to capture and recycle benzene, Riverwood determined that it was achieving a lower level of emissions reduction than the required 95 percent. Riverwood subsequently applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for another extension, proposing to add carbon adsorption equipment to address the benzene that escaped the water scrubber. The Environmental Protection Agency denied this second extension request, thereby setting up a legal dispute over whether more time was warranted.

 Some questioned whether the company’s original choice of technology was appropriate, given that carbon adsorption was also available. Riverwood contended that water scrubbing was more in line with pollution prevention strategies, while others pointed out that carbon adsorption was viable and might have been installed sooner. The debate centered on whether enough information had been provided about the time it took to implement these controls, the foreseeability of any technology’s failure, and the steps taken by Riverwood to ensure compliance.

 In favor of Riverwood Incorporated, arguments stressed that the Clean Air Act’s waiver provision contemplates up to two years for installing controls that protect against imminent endangerment. Riverwood maintained that it exercised diligence in choosing a water scrubbing system based on both prior testing and modeling, aiming to eliminate or recycle hazardous material rather than merely relocate it. Riverwood emphasized that the Environmental Protection Agency’s own policies encourage approaches that reduce waste at the source. It was argued that no one had established the company could install alternative technology faster, and that a two-year timeframe would accommodate more environmentally responsible methods. Riverwood also asserted that, once it identified the shortfall in achieving the required emission level, it swiftly proposed the additional carbon adsorption step to fulfill the statutory standard, as permitted by the Clean Air Act’s provision granting waivers when extra time is necessary.

 In favor of the Environmental Protection Agency, arguments emphasized that the waiver provision in the Clean Air Act is discretionary and does not guarantee the maximum period for compliance. The Environmental Protection Agency underscored that Riverwood knew about carbon adsorption as an effective means to achieve the 95 percent standard and could have installed it initially during its first waiver period. It was contended that if an available technology ensures prompt compliance, a facility’s ambition to pursue an alternative method should not indefinitely delay attainment of the standards meant to safeguard the public. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency noted that Riverwood had not supplied specific evidence demonstrating that installing a larger carbon adsorption system from the start would have taken substantially longer than the eleven months originally granted. The Agency also underscored that the firm, not the public, should bear the consequences of a technology that fell short of the emission reduction requirement.
