You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


One evening, Russell Hayes allegedly joined several companions on a sequence of robberies around “Greenport” in “Riverland.” According to trial evidence, they traveled in a car that had been taken earlier. Hayes sat in the back seat among his friends. During this series of incidents, at least one individual was reportedly struck in the head with a firearm by someone in the group. The government alleged that Hayes played a central part in these incidents and worked with his companions to target multiple victims over the course of the night.

 A confrontation arose involving a person named Jason Keller, who was on a motor scooter. The group’s car forced Keller off the road, causing him to fall into nearby bushes. Multiple witnesses, including one associated with Hayes, stated that Hayes and another individual, Daniel West, fired shots as Keller rolled away in the grass. One shot caught Keller in the foot, and he later testified he heard someone urge the others to capture him. The group fled when Keller pretended to be seriously harmed or unconscious.

 Authorities apprehended Hayes and the other individuals not long after the final confrontation. Hayes was subsequently charged under several provisions, including one regarding assault with intent to commit mayhem, which involved 14 V.I.C. § 1341. During the trial, jurors were informed of a disputed instruction indicating that if an injury was inflicted, this could stand as presumptive evidence of the requisite intent. Hayes took issue with whether the law allowed the jury to infer intent automatically once it found that a victim was hurt. The government, for its part, maintained that the jury still had the final say on whether Hayes possessed the necessary intent.

 In support of Hayes’s position, it was argued that relying on a presumption of intent violates fundamental guarantees demanding that every criminal element be fully proven rather than assumed. He cited longstanding precedent to the effect that intent must be decided by the jury without any mandated inference triggered simply by proof of harm. According to these arguments, statutes should not make a specific intent element a near certainty upon showing bodily injury. Hayes’s reasoning centered on the principle that any shift or weakening of the requirement to prove mens rea contravenes due process and the presumption of innocence. Several notable decisions were invoked to underscore that the prosecution, not the accused, must demonstrate each ingredient of the offense. In this view, even an instruction that suggests it is “merely evidence” can improperly nudge jurors to forgo independent consideration of the defendant’s actual mindset.

 In support of the government’s position, it was argued that the language in 14 V.I.C. § 1341 logically fits within longstanding practices that allow a fact finder to consider injury as indicative of possible intent, so long as the instruction is understood to grant jurors discretion in reaching their conclusions. Citing various authorities, the government contended that a permissive inference need not violate due process if it simply lets jurors draw a rational link between the basic fact of infliction of harm and the element of intent. The government stressed that courts routinely uphold statutes which highlight circumstantial evidence of mens rea. Moreover, it was asserted that any presumption could be overcome or rendered irrelevant if the accused shows any plausible contrary explanation or if the overall trial evidence casts doubt on intent. By this reasoning, the limited reliance on an inference of intentional harm upon proof of an actual injury is rooted in centuries of common-law tradition, signaling consistency with established legal standards.
