You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Bernini Foods operates as a maker of pizza products. Larsen Meat Co. supplies sausage to Bernini Foods, extending credit terms and shipping products over a significant period. Within a 90-day span before Bernini Foods initiated bankruptcy proceedings, Bernini Foods issued multiple checks to Larsen Meat Co. for outstanding invoices.

 The invoices from Larsen Meat Co. generally stated that payment was due within a short time (seven days), though actual payment practices for the industry commonly stretched beyond this written term. Historically, Bernini Foods often submitted payments later than those stated invoice due dates. During the relevant period, Bernini Foods made some payments to Larsen Meat Co. within roughly 12 to 32 days, an approach that departed from the nominal seven-day term yet was consistent with a longer-standing pattern of leniency in their relationship. This established flexibility between the two businesses had persisted for years before the bankruptcy filing.

 Disagreement later arose concerning whether the payments should be classified as allowable or as avoidable under 11 U.S.C. § 547, especially focusing on whether the payments met the requirement to be “made according to ordinary business terms.” Conflicting viewpoints emerged on whether “ordinary business terms” should be measured relative to practices within the general industry or solely by reference to a course of dealing specifically between Bernini Foods and Larsen Meat Co. Testimony highlighted typical industry practices that deviated from printed invoice terms, along with instances of preferred treatment for certain customers.

 Larsen Meat Co. presented arguments grounded in the text of 11 U.S.C. § 547 and prior case law, emphasizing that its dealings with Bernini Foods had long involved comparable delays and that such timing was standard both for their pairwise course of business and for a broad segment of the sausage-supply industry. They argued that the statute’s exception can be satisfied when the timing of payments aligns with norms witnessed among similarly situated suppliers and buyers, not solely with strict invoicing language. Larsen Meat Co. cited the importance of fair-credit practices and consistent accommodations in the industry, asserting that so long as invoices are regularly paid within a range commonly accepted among comparable businesses, the protection of 11 U.S.C. § 547(c)(2) should apply. They underscored their history of extending leniency, noting that this leniency was not particular to Bernini Foods but reflected a larger business reality where formal invoice terms often go unenforced to maintain customer relationships.

 Bernini Foods advanced a counter-argument suggesting that Larsen Meat Co. needed to show actual uniformity between the payment schedule it tolerated for Bernini Foods and the broader industry standards. Bernini Foods contended that the policy underlying 11 U.S.C. § 547 seeks to prevent selective treatment of particular creditors in the period before a bankruptcy filing, and that any payment pattern significantly diverging from typical deadlines or from industry norms poses the risk of laying one creditor ahead of others. They stressed that any departure from standard invoicing schedules, especially those etched in industry practice, indicates an extraordinary arrangement that might undermine the equal distribution principle inherent to bankruptcy law. Pointing to witness testimony about occasional extensions for favored customers, Bernini Foods argued that Larsen Meat Co. had not established a consistent, industry-wide tolerance for payment delays of the kind noted in Bernini Foods’s case.
