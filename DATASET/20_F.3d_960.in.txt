You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jane Carey is a citizen of Canada who arrived in the United States in 1978 as a lawful permanent resident and resided in California. She was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, which led the INS to initiate deportation proceedings. She applied for a waiver that can be granted under certain provisions of the immigration laws.

 In support of her position, Jane Carey and others described her close and longstanding relationship with Mr. Bowen. According to Mr. Bowen and various members of his extended family, Jane Carey was considered akin to a spouse in a committed relationship, even though no formal ceremony had taken place. Statements indicated that the couple had long intended to marry if her immigration status allowed her to remain in the United States. The relationship was portrayed as a substantial familial bond, and additional testimony highlighted her social ties, her continued residence, and her personal contributions in California.

 The case materials also indicated that Jane Carey’s serious drug-related offenses formed the basis for her deportation. There was discussion of whether she had taken any steps to formalize her relationship as a common law marriage under any jurisdiction. According to some accounts, without a recognized legal marriage, the relationship might be afforded less weight when balancing positive and negative factors. References were made to how diverse federal statutes, including certain portions of the bankruptcy code and portions of the tax code, rely on state law for defining marriage or property interests, implying that federal agencies might reasonably do the same for immigration decisions.

 Proponents of Jane Carey’s position argue at length that the immigration laws are intended to be applied uniformly, referencing key principles drawn from federal courts and statutory provisions such as 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). They point to authority suggesting Congress did not signal any reliance on local definitions of marriage; rather, they highlight prior rulings indicating that immigration law should not produce differing results based on variations among state domestic relations rules. They assert that prioritizing an individual’s deep personal and familial bonds—regardless of whether their relationship is formally recognized by the state—serves the goal of reviewing each case on its merits, consistent with the overall statutory emphasis on equitable relief in certain deportation proceedings.

 Those supporting the INS position put forward arguments rooted in the longstanding practice of deferring to state definitions regarding family relationships. They cite examples from federal statutes, including portions of the bankruptcy code and federal criminal law, that routinely depend on state law for determining property and marital status, underscoring the administrative clarity provided by using state-law definitions. This viewpoint also contends that failing to require a legally recognized marriage could open the door to many different forms of partnerships demanding identical treatment, an outcome they say is neither practical nor aligned with the statute’s design. Consequently, the INS side maintains that the distinction between formally recognized spouses and individuals who lack any official recognition of their union is both logical and reasonably related to the purposes of the immigration statute.
