You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Harper Investors brought a class action lawsuit involving a tax shelter investment they had originally purchased through Gold Reserve & Lending. That company’s contract with Harper Investors contained an arbitration clause stating that any controversies “arising out of or relating to” the agreement would be subject to arbitration. Later, Jon Davidson, who was not originally a signatory to that contract, purchased Gold Reserve & Lending and became involved in certain dealings with Harper Investors in connection with the container leasing program and related matters.

 The litigation turned on whether Jon Davidson, as a non-signatory, would be allowed to compel arbitration against Harper Investors. Harper Investors alleged that Davidson became involved in the alleged fraudulent tax shelter scheme after they had signed the original contract with Gold Reserve & Lending. At some point in the proceedings, Harper Investors obtained an order of default against Davidson, while Davidson simultaneously sought to compel arbitration, asserting his right to do so under the existing agreement between Harper Investors and Gold Reserve & Lending. The district court addressed discovery issues and other interlocutory matters, and the question arose as to whether Davidson’s role and status gave him standing to enforce the arbitration clause.

 Davidson had acted as an officer, director, and eventual owner of Gold Reserve & Lending (through an entity called National Freight Consolidated), as well as operating under a separate consulting entity called Universal Business Services. Harper Investors claimed that Davidson formed additional organizations, such as Fund Restoration Alliance and Tax Support Circle, from which he solicited funds under the guise of helping investors. They alleged that Davidson encouraged them not to pursue certain lawsuits while implying that he was working on their behalf. They contended these deeds bore on Davidson’s attempt to use the original arbitration provision to resolve the dispute, even though he had not personally signed the original investment contracts.

 In arguing that Harper Investors should prevail, numerous points appear in the opinion supporting the view that Davidson may not enforce the arbitration provision. First, certain legal authorities are cited for the principle that a contractual right to arbitrate ordinarily belongs only to the original parties or to someone with a clear, legally recognized connection to the agreement, such as an assignee or intended beneficiary. According to Lorber Industries of California v. Los Angeles Printworks Corp., only a party (or its agent or beneficiary) may exercise a contract’s arbitration right. Related cases underscore that nonsignatories have no such rights absent a showing of clear intent, an actual assignment, or a similar formal process satisfying ordinary contract requirements. Second, there is discussion that even if a person claims to be an agent or successor, the alleged wrongdoing must specifically arise from, or closely relate to, the original contract for the arbitration clause to apply. Statutes and established precedents addressing third-party beneficiary doctrine similarly emphasize that the contracting parties must have intended to confer enforcement rights upon the nonsignatory, which Harper Investors argued was not the case. Third, the arguments assembled for Harper Investors emphasize that simply taking control of or acquiring a signatory company does not automatically confer standing to enforce the arbitration clause, especially if the alleged misconduct lies outside the contract’s core obligations or if the events at issue involve separate acts of alleged fraud.

 By contrast, in presenting reasons why Jon Davidson should prevail, the opinion sets out arguments that a broad arbitration clause of this sort is presumed to cover a wide array of disputes. Key authorities, including AT & T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, confirm that when a contract says “arising out of or relating to,” courts generally favor arbitration of the dispute. Davidson’s position stresses that the breadth of language in typical commercial arbitration agreements means disputes closely intertwined with the original transaction should be subject to arbitration. Davidson also cites the strong federal policy favoring arbitration, noting that doubts should be resolved in its favor. The arguments further insist that if the alleged wrongdoing can be traced in some measure to Davidson’s tenure as an officer or director of Gold Reserve & Lending, then his acts would be connected to the sales contracts—triggering the very arbitration clause that was included to handle any controversy. Davidson’s stance includes the contention that becoming president, director, or an agent of that entity effectively places the nonsignatory within the ambit of the agreement’s arbitration provision, as courts have sometimes permitted high-level agents or affiliates to use such clauses if the dispute relates in any way to the underlying contract in question.
