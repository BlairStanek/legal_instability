You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Taylor Hill filed a class action on behalf of individuals seeking disability benefits under programs established by the Social Security Act. Those programs included benefits for children and for certain surviving and divorced spouses. Taylor Hill asserted that, under regulations promoted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, claimants were obligated to prove an exact or equivalent match to a specific entry in a detailed list of impairments, and that this policy unfairly denied claimants a full evaluation of their ability to perform activities or engage in work.

 According to Taylor Hill, the rules adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services required an overly narrow, predetermined approach. They argued that, if a claimant’s medical condition did not fit neatly into a recognized category in the Secretary’s listing, the claim was rejected, regardless of whether multiple combined impairments effectively limited the claimant in the same way. Taylor Hill therefore contended that these regulations were incompatible with provisions of the Social Security Act that call for a careful individual assessment of a claimant’s overall capacity.

 After a period of litigation in the district court and in the appellate court, the dispute expanded to whether attorney’s fees and costs were warranted under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Taylor Hill contended that the Secretary’s stance on the underlying regulations—and the manner in which those regulations were defended—lacked a sound justification. The Secretary of Health and Human Services maintained that the agency’s policies were appropriately formulated under existing law and that earlier legal decisions had lent support to the agency’s interpretation of the Act.

 In support of Taylor Hill’s position, various authorities were invoked to suggest that the Social Security Act obliges the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide a tailored assessment of each individual’s circumstances. Taylor Hill relied heavily on the text of the Act’s disability provisions, read together with precedents indicating that a standard requiring strict matching to a listed impairment may conflict with the statutory directive to account for the totality of a person’s limitations. They further pointed to cases in which courts had interpreted such regulations as exceeding the agency’s authority when they foreclosed consideration of real-world functional abilities. Finally, Taylor Hill argued that language in key precedents describing improper or overly rigid tests for disability demonstrated an overarching principle that a thorough functional inquiry is a statutory necessity, thus placing the Secretary’s narrower rules in tension with well-established legal requirements.

 In support of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it was advanced that the regulations were grounded in reasonable readings of the Social Security Act. The Secretary stressed that, prior to these proceedings, other appellate courts had accepted or at least acknowledged the validity of a similar listing-based system for determining children’s and spouses’ disability. This, argued the Secretary, showed that the statutory text was sufficiently ambiguous to allow for different plausible interpretations. The Secretary further emphasized that the listing-based method was neither novel nor universally rejected, and that the clear presence of other judicial rulings upholding the list-driven approach demonstrated that the Secretary’s interpretation of the Act was guided by legitimate considerations. In addition, the Secretary noted that no definitive legal precedent, at the time the regulations were set, expressly required a separate assessment of every individual’s functional abilities beyond the listing comparison, reinforcing the view that policymakers had acted within allowable discretion.
