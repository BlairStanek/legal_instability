You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Sam Jenkins was employed by Central Southeastern Railroad Company. He alleges that on a day in January 1989, while descending steps on a locomotive, he slipped on oil that had collected on a walkway. Photographs taken the following day show several spots of oil, with one patch measuring over a foot in length and partially covering the width of the walkway. Jenkins contends that he slipped in the largest patch, which he describes as a puddle. There is conflicting testimony about whether this oil patch was visibly wet and hazardous, or instead relatively dry and “crusty,” without footprints or any indication that it had caused a slip.

 Jenkins claims that, after falling into the oil, he discovered it had soaked his clothing and personal belongings. He attributes injuries to his lower back and left ankle to this fall. He recounts multiple times afterward when his ankle supposedly gave way, causing further harm, including an injury to his hand. In response, the railroad presents evidence suggesting that at least one subsequent injury may have arisen from causes unrelated to any ankle instability. Jenkins had also injured his ankle, wrist, and back in a prior incident for which he accepted a settlement, but he maintains that the previous injuries had fully healed before the January 1989 fall. Conflicting accounts also exist about whether oil was visible on Jenkins’s clothes immediately following the alleged slip.

 Jenkins’s lawsuit rests on the assertion that the railroad is strictly responsible for ensuring that the locomotive was maintained in a safe condition, pursuant to the Boiler Inspection Act, 45 U.S.C. § 23, and relevant regulations, including 49 C.F.R. § 229.119(c). Under the statute, any locomotive and its appurtenances must be safe to operate without posing unnecessary peril to life or limb. Regulations further specify that floors and passageways should be kept free from substances like oil and water if they create slipping, tripping, or fire hazards. Whether a certain patch of oil is automatically a violation or must be shown to create an actual hazard is disputed. Both sides bring forth testimony regarding visibility, the locomotive’s non-skid surface, and whether the oil might have been a peril under the statute and its implementing rules.

 In support of the position favoring Central Southeastern Railroad Company, arguments emphasize that the Boiler Inspection Act is not violated merely because oil is present. Supporters of this view rely on the phrasing that locomotives must be kept safe without “unnecessary peril,” contending that a slippery or hazardous condition must be proven, as opposed to a mere presence of oil. They reference rulings recognizing that safety statutes require an actual threat to employee well-being, rather than imposing liability in all instances where oil or a similar substance appears. Written regulations allow for everyday conditions, such as minor residue or crusted material, as long as they do not present a true slipping or tripping hazard. Under these arguments, evidence that the oil patch was dry or dusty, that it lacked footprints or marks suggesting a slip, and that Jenkins was not required to use that particular location, supports the conclusion that no violation necessarily occurred.

 In support of the position favoring Sam Jenkins, arguments stress that the Boiler Inspection Act and its regulations impose an “absolute” and “continuing” duty to protect employees from dangers that can arise on locomotives. From this perspective, 49 C.F.R. § 229.119(c) plainly requires that floors and passageways be kept free of substances like oil, implying automatic liability when such substances are present where workers must walk. Proponents of this reading note that the Act is to be liberally construed to protect railroad employees, and emphasize that strict compliance with the regulation is essential, as any quantity of oil could pose risks. They point to language in case law regarding the importance of preventing all unnecessary perils, arguing that if oil is found in a place employees are likely to step, it constitutes a violation, regardless of whether one could see it or whether it appeared “crusty.” This position highlights the protective goal of the Boiler Inspection Act and the benefits of ensuring absolute safety through strict enforcement.
