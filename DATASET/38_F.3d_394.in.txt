You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Blaine Salazar entered into a written plea agreement as part of criminal proceedings in the district court. At issue was a provision in the agreement concerning his right to appeal his sentence. Mr. Salazar, who is not a native English speaker, had the written agreement read to him, and, according to the record, he discussed it with his lawyer. Mr. Salazar had spent part of his childhood receiving some education in the United States and had also attended school in Mexico.

 The Government contended that the written plea agreement clearly reflected Mr. Salazar’s awareness of his right to appeal under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a) and that, by its terms, he waived that right if the sentence imposed did not exceed a specified limit. The document was described as straightforward, referencing the right to appeal and the explicit waiver. A presentence report prepared before sentencing included a statement clarifying that, under the agreement, Mr. Salazar would give up his right to challenge his sentence on appeal.

 Mr. Salazar claimed confusion about the waiver language, emphasizing that no one specifically explained it on the record. He pointed out that the district court judge did not mention the waiver at the hearing on his change of plea, did not confirm that Mr. Salazar understood the consequences of giving up the right to appeal, and did not personally address the appellate waiver before accepting the plea. Mr. Salazar maintained that his limited exposure to the English language and the complexity of the waiver provision created uncertainty about whether he truly grasped the implications. He also asserted that the district court did not advise him of any separate right to appeal following the imposition of sentence.

 In support of enforcing the waiver, the Government relies on case authority holding that a defendant may waive statutory appellate rights through a knowing and voluntary plea agreement, as outlined in decisions such as United States v. Navarro-Botello and United States v. Bolinger. The Government emphasizes that the plea document expressly warned Mr. Salazar about relinquishing appellate options, that it was read to him in Spanish, and that he had counsel to consult. It stresses that the reference to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), along with other statutory citations within the agreement, demonstrates an intent to include all sentencing appeals as part of the waiver unless certain conditions were not met. The Government also asserts that even if the waiver language is examined without a specific colloquy, clear notice was nonetheless provided because the plea agreement and the presentence report both spelled out the terms of the waiver.

 In support of invalidating the waiver, Mr. Salazar contends that any waiver of appellate rights must be knowingly and voluntarily made and that the district court must ensure that a defendant understands the consequences of relinquishing such rights. He highlights cases including United States v. Wessells and United States v. Marin, pointing to the importance of a thorough dialogue on the record. Mr. Salazar insists that reading the plea agreement once, particularly in light of the confusing structure of the waiver provision, did not suffice to inform him of the extent to which he would give up important rights. He further points to the requirement, as contained in authorities discussing rules such as Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(a)(2), that a defendant be explicitly advised of the right to appeal after sentencing. Because the judge did not personally address this at his plea hearing or sentencing, Mr. Salazar argues that the omission contributes to a lack of certainty that he fully understood the waiver.
