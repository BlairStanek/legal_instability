You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Sam Morales was charged with multiple counts related to a controlled substance and a government benefit program under federal law. The district court convicted him on the counts and imposed a sentence that included a monetary assessment. A reviewing court later directed the district court to set aside one of the convictions and to reduce the monetary assessment by a specified amount.

 Before the new hearing occurred, Sam Morales dismissed his court-appointed lawyer, Mr. Fletcher. At the subsequent proceeding in the district court, he appeared without representation. Sam Morales requested counsel, but the district court proceeded with the hearing. During this appearance, the district court confirmed that one of the convictions would be dismissed and the assessment reduced, while otherwise maintaining the prior sentence.

 Sam Morales puts forward the view that the proceeding should have been treated as an opportunity for a complete reconsideration of his punishment. He contends that removing one conviction might affect the length or nature of his sentence and that counsel’s assistance would be important. The United States insists that the proceeding was strictly limited by the reviewing court’s directive, leaving no meaningful discretion for altering the broader terms of imprisonment or supervision.

 One central argument advanced for the United States is that any error stemming from Sam Morales not having counsel would have no practical effect, since the district court was required only to conform to the clear directives from the reviewing court. Supporters of this position point to authorities emphasizing that, when no factual or legal decisions remain for the district court to make, the assistance of counsel may not change the result. These advocates rely on established precedent interpreting harmless error principles in the context of sentencing adjustments and note that, under those precedents, if the district court’s role is purely ministerial, no substantial rights are at stake. They invoke cases holding that the district court’s lack of discretion can make an alleged deprivation of counsel at an ancillary hearing legally inconsequential.

 A leading argument proposed for Sam Morales is that any resentencing procedure—even one constrained by an appellate directive—qualifies as a critical part of the criminal process and therefore requires the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Proponents of this view maintain that whenever a defendant’s sentence is pronounced or modified, even minimally, counsel must be present to protect the defendant’s interests. They draw on cases establishing that resentencing is not merely administrative, and highlight that a defendant’s substantial rights can be affected in various subtle ways. They also cite precedent underscoring that, when a conviction is vacated on double jeopardy or similar grounds, there may still be sentencing flexibility that would benefit from counsel’s advocacy. Finally, they stress that denial of counsel at such a stage is a fundamental deprivation that should not be subject to arguments about harmlessness, insisting that structural protections of the right to counsel cannot be waived or bypassed without explicit findings.
