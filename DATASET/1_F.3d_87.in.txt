You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1989, the SEC began investigating potential violations of federal securities laws by Tyler West and others, centering on securities trades in his personal brokerage accounts. Early in the inquiry, Tyler West received a subpoena calling for him to appear before the SEC and provide documents, including his 1988 pocket-sized calendar where he tracked everyday appointments and phone numbers. Initially, Tyler West invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. Later, following a change in legal counsel, he withdrew that privilege claim. At that point, the SEC withdrew its earlier subpoena, negotiated deadlines on future requests, and extended the time for any eventual enforcement recommendation against Tyler West.

 In late 1990, Tyler West met with the SEC in New York and answered questions about his trading activity. Soon after, the SEC asked him to turn over “desk calendars, diaries, and appointment books,” among other things. In early 1991, Tyler West gave the SEC various papers, including a photocopy of the 1988 calendar, and he requested that these materials be kept confidential. Each page was marked to limit outside disclosure. The SEC nonetheless questioned Tyler West again several months later, including about entries from early March 1988 that were particularly important to the investigation. Meanwhile, through its own channels, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York received a copy of Tyler West’s calendar, prompting concern that certain entries had been obscured or removed before the copy was delivered.

 In late 1990, a grand jury in New York was investigating whether Tyler West or others had engaged in obstruction of justice and perjury. It issued a subpoena directing Tyler West to produce the original 1988 calendar for possible forensic review of any “whited-out” areas. Tyler West then asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege once more, contending that producing the original calendar, with potentially altered entries, would be self-incriminating. Tyler West also argued that the government’s request resulted from improper disclosures by the SEC, which he claimed had agreed to keep his documents confidential.

 Those supporting the government’s position contend that voluntarily created documents, such as Tyler West’s 1988 calendar, fall outside the Fifth Amendment’s self-incrimination protections under precedents including Fisher v. United States and Andresen v. Maryland. They assert that the Fifth Amendment only bars compelled testimony and that a pre-existing document cannot itself be viewed as “compelled” simply because it may be incriminating. On this view, the act of producing the original calendar is not testimonial where the government already knows its existence and location, meaning any “authentication” or admissions tied to production are minimal. The government’s supporters further suggest that, under cases like Baltimore Dep’t of Social Servs. v. Bouknight, requiring a person to turn over certain evidence does not exceed constitutional bounds if it does not force that person to provide new testimonial statements. Finally, they argue that any confidentiality arrangements with the SEC cannot override a grand jury’s broad entitlement to relevant information, emphasizing that well-established legal doctrines favor enforcing valid subpoenas to uncover possible wrongdoing.

 Those advocating Tyler West’s position invoke Boyd v. United States for the principle that deeply personal writings remain protected by the Fifth Amendment if their compelled production effectively forces a person to bear witness against himself. They maintain that Tyler West’s calendar is a uniquely private sort of diary, in which its contents are inseparable from his own thoughts and recollections. On this view, ensuring the privacy of such intimate personal material is a core reason for allowing a Fifth Amendment shield against production. They emphasize that a calendar containing private notes differs from business or financial records created for transactions with others, so the rationale from Fisher and related decisions should not apply. Moreover, they argue that compelling an original document when the government suspects alterations effectively forces Tyler West to authenticate or confirm that information was changed, thereby crossing into self-incrimination. Citing Boyd again, they assert that the constitutional safeguard should not be diluted merely because one chose to record personal matters on paper; forcibly exposing a person’s most private reflections, they contend, is precisely the kind of compelled testimonial act the Constitution was designed to prevent.
