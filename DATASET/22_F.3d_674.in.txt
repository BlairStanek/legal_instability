You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On a weekday afternoon in Riverpoint, Michigan, officers from the local police department arrived at an apartment after receiving reports that a teenager, Madison King, was being held there against her will. The front door was behind a locked, reinforced gate. Officers, including Officer Patrick and Officer Barnes, eventually forced the lock open with a neighbor’s tools. They found Madison inside, alone and unable to leave. According to Madison, the occupant of the apartment, Garcia, had kept her there and threatened to harm her if she attempted to escape.

 Madison described multiple forced sexual encounters over the preceding days, stating that Garcia threatened her and her family with firearms. Madison led the officers to a closet in the apartment where, based on her account, Garcia kept guns. The officers seized weapons and ammunition from that closet. Later, personnel from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms obtained a warrant for a broader search, during which more ammunition, but no additional guns, was found. Following these events, Garcia was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon and unlawful possession of ammunition by a felon.

 As the case proceeded in the district court, Garcia challenged the initial search of his apartment and the later search under the warrant. He also objected to being classified as an armed career criminal for sentencing purposes, arguing that the state convictions supporting that classification were invalid. He further claimed that imposing a lengthy sentence for his felon-in-possession offense was grossly disproportionate in light of his prior convictions. Cooke, representing the government’s position, opposed these challenges and asked the district court to uphold both the searches and the enhanced sentence.

 In support of Garcia’s position, several arguments focused on the Fourth Amendment. Garcia contended that Madison lacked any real authority to consent to police entry or to the seizure of the items in the closet, emphasizing her status as someone forcibly confined and locked in the apartment. Garcia also maintained that the officers, once having freed Madison, had time and opportunity to secure the apartment and obtain a warrant before taking further action. He argued that any subsequent warrant was tainted by the initial, allegedly unlawful search. Garcia likewise challenged the validity of his older state convictions used to enhance his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, citing case law requiring that guilty pleas be entered knowingly and voluntarily. Finally, he invoked the Eighth Amendment, claiming that a mandatory sentence exceeding a decade for merely possessing a firearm was disproportionate in light of his past nonviolent burglary offenses.

 Cooke advanced contrary arguments, beginning with the contention that Madison’s actions and statements implied valid consent for the officers to seize the firearms since she directed them to the closet. Further, Cooke asserted that the need to protect a victim and secure dangerous weapons amounted to exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless seizure. Cooke argued in the alternative that, even if the discovery of the firearms were deemed unlawful, there was good-faith reliance on the subsequently issued federal warrant. Citing established precedent, Cooke also challenged Garcia’s assertion that his older state convictions were invalid, pointing to transcripts and colloquies in state court proceedings showing that his guilty pleas were entered knowingly. Finally, under federal law defining burglary as a violent felony, Cooke insisted that Garcia’s looping prior break-ins, even if older in date, qualified as proper predicates mandating an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act.
