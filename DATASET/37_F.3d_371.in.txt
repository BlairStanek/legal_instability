You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1986, Casey Green was tried in a criminal proceeding and found guilty of first-degree murder of a spouse. Soon afterward, the state appellate court overturned that conviction due to concerns about improperly excluded evidence at trial. Subsequently, the case returned for another trial, after which Casey Green was again convicted of first-degree murder. While awaiting the final sentencing hearing, Casey Green had been released on bail.

 Casey Green did not appear for sentencing as ordered, remaining absent for three days and then being apprehended in a nearby county. Upon return to the trial court, Casey Green was formally sentenced to a life term of imprisonment with no parole eligibility for fifty years. After sentencing, Casey Green filed both a direct appeal and a postconviction motion. These two matters were consolidated before the state appellate court. Despite the case being fully briefed and orally argued, that court applied a procedural rule commonly known as the fugitive dismissal rule and dismissed Casey Green’s appeals.

 Historically, this fugitive dismissal rule has existed in the jurisdiction for well over a century. It has been used to prevent individuals who evade court authority from then seeking a full appellate review. In previous instances, courts have emphasized that the rule promotes respect for the legal process and deters further absconding. At the same time, it is recognized that such a rule might be invoked whether the flight took place before or during the appeal, depending on how local courts interpret and apply it. These circumstances created questions as to whether Casey Green’s three-day absence, concluding prior to the filing of any appeal, sufficiently justified dismissal of the appeals, or whether different considerations should have governed the outcome.

 Casey Green’s strongest legal arguments focus on the principle that the fugitive dismissal rule was improperly applied. Supporters of this view emphasize that Casey Green’s absence lasted only three days and concluded before the appeals formally began. They contend that there was no disruption to appellate proceedings, no interference with the ability of the appellate court to render an enforceable judgment, and no delay in filing the appeal within the standard timeframe. Citing established case law, they argue that procedural or substantive due process requires an opportunity to have appeals heard on the merits once the right to appeal is granted by the state. Because Casey Green complied with all appellate deadlines and was present by the time the proceedings could properly move forward, they contend that using the fugitive dismissal rule in these circumstances serves no legitimate appellate purpose, amounts to arbitrary imposition of a penalty, and is inconsistent with due process protections.

 The State’s strongest legal arguments rest on a long-standing tradition that convicted individuals who disregard court authority do not deserve to benefit from the appellate structure if they voluntarily absent themselves. The State highlights that no constitutional text guarantees a right to appeal a criminal conviction and that a state may attach reasonable conditions to any such right it confers. Citing historical rulings, the State underscores the importance of discouraging unlawful flight and maintaining the integrity of the court’s authority. According to these arguments, once Casey Green failed to appear for sentencing, this conduct demonstrated contempt for the law, and dismissing the subsequent appeals was a permissible method to deter future similar misconduct and to preserve respect for the judicial process. Furthermore, the State points out that punishing such flight through the denial of an otherwise available appellate review is a recognized practice in line with established precedent.
