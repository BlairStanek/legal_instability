You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A series of events began when Officer Adams, working with a narcotics law enforcement unit in Randolph County, Missouri, received information that significant amounts of marijuana were for sale. Officer Adams’s informant, Mateo, introduced him to Daniel Ortiz, who stated that there was an opportunity to purchase large quantities of marijuana through a supplier. Over several days, Ortiz negotiated with Officer Adams about the price and the amount of marijuana available.

 During these negotiations, Ortiz mentioned that his source, Pablo, could obtain around 150 pounds of marijuana. However, information soon emerged that the amount might have been reduced to 30 pounds. On the day of an arranged transaction, Ortiz and Mateo picked up Andrew Delgado, and they later met Pablo and Pablo’s brother, Miguel. They all converged first at Delgado’s house, and then near a local lodging establishment, the Econo Stay, where the sale was supposed to occur. Miguel remained behind at the vehicle to guard the marijuana, while the others entered the Econo Stay to meet with Officer Adams.

 After arrests were made at the Econo Stay, Pablo consented to a search of a residence at 4605 Newberry in Lakeview, Missouri, where Pablo and Miguel lived. Officers discovered 43.05 pounds of marijuana packaged in a manner similar to the 30 pounds found at the Econo Stay, along with money, firearms, and repackaging materials. In subsequent proceedings, the question arose whether this additional 43.05 pounds of marijuana should be considered part of the overall conspiracy. Redwood took the position that various phone calls, prior interaction, and the nature of the packaging pointed to a single, ongoing effort to distribute marijuana involving both Delgado and Ortiz. Sanchez disputed the view that Delgado or Ortiz had any knowledge of or connection to the marijuana discovered at 4605 Newberry.

 Redwood’s arguments centered on the contention that the phone records, the shared location for an initial meeting, and repeated references to substantial quantities of marijuana showed active coordination among all parties. Redwood cited provisions under 21 U.S.C. § 846 and related sentencing guidelines, emphasizing that the breadth of a conspiracy can extend to drugs stored elsewhere if the conspirators mutually rely on that supply. Redwood also pointed to standard principles under federal conspiracy law, stressing that any defendant’s foreseeability of a co-conspirator’s possession of sizable drug amounts could be inferred from ongoing dealings, identical packaging materials, and repeated telephone discussions aimed at facilitating larger-scale transactions.

 Sanchez’s arguments contended that Delgado and Ortiz merely participated in a single, discrete delivery. They relied on the idea that conspiracy law under 21 U.S.C. § 846 requires a clear agreement encompassing all items attributed to the conspiracy, which they argued was never established for the 43.05 pounds found at 4605 Newberry. They emphasized that Delgado and Ortiz were not shown to have any direct involvement with the additional marijuana, and contended that no evidence demonstrated that they had ever handled, discussed, or even expected those packages. Sanchez relied on precedents cautioning against expanding the scope of a conspiracy beyond tangible acts or overt evidence of mutual understanding, arguing that the sentencing guidelines protect defendants from responsibility for unrelated activities by others unless the conduct in question was clearly part of a jointly undertaken criminal plan.
