You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this matter, a ship crew member named Leon Martin accepted contraband while in Harbor City, Colombia, allegedly to deliver it upon arrival in Newvale. Government agents, having previously arranged for Martin’s cooperation, permitted this handoff and intended to monitor the eventual recipient of the items. After Martin’s vessel, the M/V Coral Mariner, docked in Newvale, Martin proceeded to the Shoreline Inn, following instructions to locate an individual named Henry Day.

 While at the Shoreline Inn, Martin asked for Day at the front desk. Instead, Jacob Stone came forward and escorted Martin to a specific hotel room. Martin carried a bag containing contraband and stated that he was supposed to give it to Day. Stone indicated that Day would soon arrive, used a cellular phone in an effort to reach him, and even proposed moving the items to a different location in the hotel, an idea Martin declined. During this time, Martin retained the bag and declined to relinquish control of it. Eventually, Martin and Stone left that room, leaving the bag behind.

 Shortly after stepping into the corridor, agents detained both men and then returned with Stone to the room where the bag remained. Several phone calls were placed or received, apparently associated with Day, but Day did not appear in person. Meanwhile, agents outside observed unrelated individuals in a vehicle near the hotel. When these individuals entered another room and were approached, they attempted to flee. Agents later found a weapon and currency in their car. Stone was subsequently charged with possession of the contraband with intent to distribute, and other counts were brought against him but are not central here. Stone maintained that he never exercised exclusive control over the bag, had not paid for its contents, and was not the intended recipient.

 According to one position, liability is appropriate under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) so long as a person knowingly has the authority and intention to control contraband, even if not physically holding it. It is argued that constructive possession can be demonstrated by evidence that the items were placed in a room whose occupant was fully aware of their presence, had ready access, and was facilitating their eventual transfer. It is further contended that knowledge of the contents, involvement in orchestrating phone calls, and managing the next step in distribution, especially when combined with proximity in one’s own space, suffice to show both power and readiness to exercise control. Under case precedent interpreting constructive possession, the fact that contraband is in a location specially accessible to the person is viewed as a key indicator of dominion, and this position points to similar rulings where objects were placed in a home or vehicle, establishing the occupant’s immediate power and intent.

 A competing position contends that 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) requires far more than vague proximity or joint presence. It emphasizes that possession—actual or constructive—demands a showing of ownership rights or authority over the items, not merely knowledge and physical capability. The argument is that someone who lacks any legal or recognized authority to handle or remove the contraband does not truly possess it. In this view, Stone’s inability to relocate the contraband without Martin’s agreement, his lack of any completed transaction, and the absence of a confirmed right to control the items disqualify him from meeting the statutory definition of possession. Citing various cases focusing on the need for demonstrable dominion, this position maintains that being in the same room or having fleeting presence does not, by itself, establish the necessary control element, no matter how suspicious the circumstances might appear.
