You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On December 16, 1992, law enforcement personnel executed a search warrant for narcotics at a residence in Lakeview, Oklahoma. While they conducted their investigation there, a telephone rang repeatedly. Each caller asked for two individuals, Eliana or Marco, who were associated with that address. During one call, a person named Talia identified herself and mentioned that she had purchased drugs from Eliana earlier in the day but was unable to sell them. She asked to return the drugs for a refund. The officer who answered the call gave a different name, told Talia that Eliana was not around, but invited Talia to come to the residence in about thirty minutes.

 Approximately thirty-five minutes later, Alex Carlson knocked on the door. Law enforcement personnel dressed in street clothes greeted him. Carlson repeatedly asked to see the individual whose name had been provided to Talia on the phone, and he conversed with the officers on the couch for several minutes. Eventually, Carlson stood up to leave, saying he would return later. One officer moved to stand in front of the exit, held out a hand, and identified himself as law enforcement. Carlson continued walking into the officer’s outstretched hand. At that point, the officer felt a firearm tucked under Carlson’s waistband. The officer later stated that Carlson tried to reach into a jacket pocket, so the officer restrained him and discovered two loaded firearms on his person.

 Alex Carlson was indicted in the district court for being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). He filed a motion to suppress the firearms, alleging that they were seized in violation of Terry v. Ohio. Later, Carlson pleaded guilty to the charge but reserved his right to challenge the suppression ruling. The Government also sought a sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), citing three prior convictions as the basis for classifying Carlson as an armed career criminal: an aggravated robbery conviction from Kansas in June 1980, an aggravated robbery conviction from Kansas in February 1973, and a second degree burglary conviction from Oklahoma in October 1966. Carlson contended that the 1966 burglary did not meet the federal definition of a “violent felony” under relevant law. The burglary charge in that case involved entering a building belonging to All-Star Auto Supply but was prosecuted under a state statute that encompassed various structures beyond buildings, including automobiles and vending machines.

 Those arguing on behalf of Alex Carlson emphasize that any detention or pat-down must strictly accord with Terry v. Ohio and that the facts, as he characterizes them, do not show the requisite suspicion to justify an immediate restraint. They point to Carlson’s decision to depart from the residence as insufficient grounds for stopping him. They also argue that the supposed discovery of the gun by the officer’s hand was not based on clear, specific, and articulable suspicion. In addition, regarding sentencing, they rely on Taylor v. United States to claim the 1966 second degree burglary conviction cannot automatically count toward an armed career criminal enhancement because the statute under which Carlson was convicted is broader than the generic form of burglary laid out in Taylor. They highlight that the mere act of being charged with an overbroad burglary offense does not prove that an individual has committed the narrower, generic burglary. They emphasize, in line with cases such as United States v. Barney, that it is essential to examine the appropriate legal documents to determine the exact offense. If those documents do not confirm that the conviction conforms precisely to the generic burglary elements, those advocating for Carlson maintain it should not be used for an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).

 Those arguing on behalf of the Government assert that the officers’ actions at the residence were justified under Terry v. Ohio because of multiple factors: the nature of the ongoing narcotics investigation, the suspicious phone calls referencing drug deals, and Carlson’s repeated interest in seeing the person who had spoken to Talia. They contend these circumstances provided reason to fear for officer safety and to suspect that Carlson might be involved in illegal activity, making a limited search permissible. As for sentencing, they insist that the 1966 burglary conviction satisfies the elements of burglary under Taylor v. United States, pointing out that Carlson faced a charge specifically referencing unlawful entry into a building, and thus all elements of a qualifying burglary were present. They further maintain that when a defendant admits guilt to a count in the charging document that describes basic elements meeting the generic burglary standard, this constitutes sufficient evidence that the conviction qualifies as a “violent felony” for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), even without further details from any plea transcript. Under this interpretation, previous convictions under broad statutes can still qualify if the charging documents and judgment confirm the defendant was convicted of burglary as defined by federal precedents.
