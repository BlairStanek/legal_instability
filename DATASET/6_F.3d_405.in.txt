You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Thomas and Angela Reeves rented a residence from Michael and Claire Everett. After some time, the relationship deteriorated when the Reeves, who are white, adopted two Black children. The Reeves alleged that Michael and Claire Everett engaged in threats and other hostile behavior directed at them because of the adoption.

 Believing that the Everetts’ actions constituted unlawful discrimination, the Reeves sued under various civil-rights theories, including a claim under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3617. When the matter was heard in the district court, several non–Fair Housing Act claims were dismissed on summary judgment. What remained proceeded to a multi-day trial. Partway through trial, the district court entered a directed verdict as to one of the Everetts, and the jury ultimately rendered a verdict favorable to the other Everett.

 After the trial, the Everetts invoked 42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(2) in asking the district court to grant them attorney’s fees and costs. The Reeves did not file a response to contest the appropriateness of such fees; subsequently, the district court awarded a sum to the Everetts for attorney’s fees. On appeal, the Reeves took the position for the first time that the award rested on an improper legal standard, emphasizing that attorney’s fees to prevailing defendants allegedly require a finding that the claims against them were frivolous, groundless, or unreasonable.

 In support of awarding attorney’s fees, the Everetts point to the language of 42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(2), which references allowing a “prevailing party” to recover such fees. They contend that they qualify as a “prevailing party” based on the court’s rulings in their favor. They also note that fee-shifting provisions in the Fair Housing Act echo similar language in civil-rights statutes, emphasizing that courts have broad discretion to grant fees to those who prevail as a matter of fairness. Their stance is that, since they successfully defended against the allegations, the plain text of the law supports recompensing them for costs incurred throughout the proceedings. They rely on recognized parallels between the Fair Housing Act’s fee-shifting provision and other civil-rights fee provisions, suggesting that under the statutory framework, it is not necessary to show that a losing party acted in bad faith before awarding fees to a prevailing defendant.

 On the other hand, the Reeves highlight several authorities, including Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm’n, to argue that when a defendant in a civil-rights case seeks fees, a specific judicial finding must confirm that the plaintiff’s claims were frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. They maintain that courts have imposed this requirement to prevent a chilling effect on private enforcement of important civil-rights statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act. According to the Reeves, private plaintiffs uniquely advance the public interest by pursuing claims of discrimination, so imposing fees without an express finding of frivolousness would sharply discourage individuals with legitimate but difficult cases from bringing suit and thus undermine the statutory purpose. They further assert that the cost of litigating civil-rights actions could become prohibitive if attorney’s fees were granted simply because a defendant prevailed, absent a showing that the claims were truly baseless.
