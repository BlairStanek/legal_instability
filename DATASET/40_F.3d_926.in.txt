You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Dexter Miller was a high school student and athlete who had repeated two grades in elementary school due to a learning disability. After eventually reaching high school, he participated in interscholastic baseball for three years. Shortly before what would have been his final year on the baseball team, Dexter Miller turned nineteen before the cutoff date set by the rules of Robinwood Athletic Association. Under those rules, a student who turns nineteen before July 1 is deemed ineligible to participate in high school sports during the ensuing school year.

 Robinwood Athletic Association is a private organization that regulates interscholastic sports in Missouri. One of its rules imposes an age limit on student-athletes, and it does not normally allow students who exceed that age limit to participate in sanctioned competitions. Dexter Miller’s high school, Lakewood High School, was a member of Robinwood Athletic Association and had agreed to abide by the group’s eligibility rules. Motivated by his learning-disability history and his desire to participate during his senior year, Dexter Miller sought a waiver of the age restriction.

 Dexter Miller believed his learning disability explained why he was older than most of his classmates and that the rule should be adjusted in his particular case. The waiver request was denied by Robinwood Athletic Association, which reasoned that allowing older athletes could create a competitive imbalance, jeopardize younger players’ safety, and encourage delays in education. Dexter Miller then sought judicial relief, alleging that Robinwood Athletic Association’s age-limit rule violated, among other statutes, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and section 1983. Pending a later decision on the merits, a court initially granted Dexter Miller an injunction, allowing him to play and barring repercussions for Lakewood High School or any competing schools.

 In support of Robinwood Athletic Association’s position that its age rule should remain in force, arguments cite the overarching purpose of eligibility standards in high school sports. The Association contends that setting a firm age cutoff is an essential requirement, as it (a) prevents older students from providing an undue physical or competitive advantage, (b) safeguards younger students from the increased risks that might accompany competition against more mature players, and (c) appropriately discourages delaying one’s academic progress solely to gain an athletic edge. Citing cases such as Southeastern Community College v. Davis and School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, the Association emphasizes that an accommodation requiring the wholesale removal of a core eligibility standard is not considered reasonable if it would fundamentally alter the nature of a program. The Association also claims it would impose a substantial administrative burden on it if it had to investigate or waive the age rule for individual athletes once the cutoff is exceeded.

 Dexter Miller’s position stresses that his disability-based need to repeat grades should not later bar him from engaging fully in the educational and extracurricular activities offered at his school, especially since his age difference stemmed directly from a learning issue. Pointing to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, his arguments invoke language acknowledging that individuals with disabilities are “qualified” if they can meet the essential requirements of a program with reasonable modifications. He maintains that a waiver or slight relaxation of the age requirement would be narrowly tailored and would not undermine the critical goals of the age-limit rule, asserting that there would be no harmful impact on safety or fairness. He also contends that courts should individually assess whether each student truly poses a risk or gains an undue advantage, citing the principle that the mere existence of a rule does not foreclose reasonable modifications for someone whose unique circumstances have placed them outside the established cutoff through no fault of their own.
