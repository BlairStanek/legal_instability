You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Felix Walker had been working as a security guard for the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs at an Air National Guard Base located in Beachfield, New York. During his civilian employment, he was also required—under his employer’s rules—to be an active member of the New York Air National Guard. This arrangement was known as “dual status,” meaning he had to serve both as a civilian security guard and as a member of the New York Air National Guard.

 Under federal military regulations, members of the Air National Guard must generally retire at age 60. Because of the employer’s dual status policy, Felix Walker’s civilian job depended on his continued membership in the Air National Guard. When he reached age 60, his Guard membership ended, so he was subsequently dismissed from his civilian position. An agreement reached in 1988 between the Division and a labor union—here called the Public Workers Alliance—provided a limited exception: Individuals who had at least ten years of consecutive civilian and Air National Guard service could remain security guards even if they were honorably discharged from the Guard. Felix Walker, however, had fewer than ten years of dual service, so this exception did not apply to him.

 The New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs maintained that requiring all security guards to be actively enlisted ensured that these guards were trained according to current military standards and ready for possible activation. It also regarded the dual status requirement as the standard means of guaranteeing familiarity with military protocols and equipment on the base. Felix Walker’s separation from the Guard at age 60 meant he could not fulfill the dual status requirement. Supporters of the Division’s policy argued that, while overlapping with age, the policy was designed mainly to ensure continuous membership in the military, thereby achieving ongoing training and availability goals.

 In arguing that Felix Walker should prevail, one position emphasized the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge an individual because of age. Supporters of this view contended that tying a civilian job to an Air National Guard membership effectively imposed a mandatory retirement age of 60 on security guards. They drew on decisions like Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris to argue that an employer cannot adopt a third party’s age-based rule to govern its own civilian workforce, regardless of whether the age requirement originally came from the military side. They further pointed out that age was necessarily the decisive factor in terminating Felix Walker because he was forced to leave the Guard solely due to reaching 60, and that this set an inextricable link between age and the loss of his civilian post.

 In arguing that the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs should prevail, one position invoked the analysis under the McDonnell Douglas framework. From this viewpoint, the Division’s requirement of continuous Air National Guard membership was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory criterion grounded in job-related training and readiness. They invoked cases such as Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins to suggest that a factor merely correlated with age is not necessarily age discrimination. The Division argued that the policy did not categorically dismiss everyone at age 60, pointing, for instance, to the provision allowing continued employment for individuals with at least ten years of service. Proponents of this view insisted that the Division’s reasons—to ensure specialized instruction, familiarity with military protocol, and availability for activation—demonstrated a neutral rationale unrelated to any bias against older individuals. They also underscored that the decision rested on membership status, not on age itself.
