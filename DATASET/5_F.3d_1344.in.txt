You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Adam Jorgensen controlled an investment account at RiverStreet Brokerage. ACME Byte Co. had previously brought an action against Jorgensen, alleging that he participated in wrongdoing involving short sales of ACME Byte Co.’s stock. ACME Byte Co. obtained a preliminary injunction from the local trial court that forbade Jorgensen or his associates from removing or transferring any proceeds traceable to the short sales.

 Around the same period, the United States secured monetary judgments against Jorgensen for outstanding liabilities. Upon discovering Jorgensen’s account at RiverStreet Brokerage, the United States served writs of execution on that broker to collect the amounts it was owed. ACME Byte Co. alerted the United States that a preliminary injunction covered any short-sale proceeds in that account. RiverStreet Brokerage stated it would not comply without a court order compelling disbursement. The United States obtained such an order from a federal court without referencing the local trial court’s injunction and received a sum of money from the account.

 ACME Byte Co. ultimately won a separate judgment in the local trial court imposing a constructive trust on all illegally gained stock-sale proceeds and directing that any funds still in the account be given to it. By the time RiverStreet Brokerage distributed the remainder, a portion had already been turned over to the United States. ACME Byte Co. then initiated an action against both the United States and RiverStreet Brokerage, asserting that the levy and turnover were wrongful and amounted to conversion. ACME Byte Co. further alleged that both the United States and RiverStreet Brokerage violated the local trial court’s injunction and sought damages on that basis.

 In support of the United States’ position, it is argued that its levy on the account was conducted under valid judgments and in conformity with lawful execution procedures. The United States maintains that any constructive trust recognized later does not extinguish the government’s right to satisfy its previously obtained judgments, because liens or levies reduced to judgment retain priority over subsequently perfected interests. The United States contends that it was not joined in the initial action that triggered the injunction, so it was never legally bound by that injunction. It also maintains that it complied with the law by obtaining a court order supporting its levy and that it acted under proper authority when it collected the funds. The United States points to federal and state rules for judgment collection that permit it to execute on a debtor’s assets even if there are other claimants, arguing that a constructive trust for a purely monetary claim does not automatically override a final money judgment obtained independently.

 In support of ACME Byte Co.’s position, it is argued that the funds at issue were always subject to the local trial court’s preliminary injunction prohibiting Jorgensen from transferring or withdrawing any short-sale proceeds. ACME Byte Co. contends that a constructive trust arises at the moment of the wrongful act, thereby vesting equitable title in the defrauded party. According to this view, it is immaterial whether the final court order establishing the constructive trust came after the government had levied on the account; once the court determined that the stock-sale profits belonged to ACME Byte Co. by operation of equity, no one else could lawfully seize or retain those proceeds. ACME Byte Co. also stresses that the United States and RiverStreet Brokerage both had actual notice of the injunction, so any unilateral levy or disbursement contravened the valid court order. ACME Byte Co. further argues that, under state law, an execution on property that is the subject of a pending action is void, and thus the United States should not be permitted to benefit from a levy performed in contradiction of the local trial court’s directive.
