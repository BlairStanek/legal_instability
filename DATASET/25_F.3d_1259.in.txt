You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to one account, David Walters was being processed into the Greenfield City Jail when he prepared to smoke a cigarette in a designated no-smoking area. At that moment, Sergeant Cameron Jones allegedly rushed up and swung a set of large brass keys toward Walters’s face multiple times. Walters claims he raised his right hand to shield his face on the third swing and was struck on the thumb, causing substantial pain and swelling. Walters further states that when he later asked to speak with a higher-ranking official, Jones threatened to harm him again with the keys.

 Walters contends he was frightened by the threat and remained uneasy for his entire stay at the Greenfield jail. He asserts that after this incident, he repeatedly requested medical attention for his hand, claiming ongoing pain in cold or rainy conditions or when writing extensively. He indicates that his medical inquiries were ignored or dismissed. Jones, meanwhile, disputes that Walters suffered any noticeable physical harm and states that no documentation of a hand injury appeared in Walters’s jail medical records.

 Jones maintains that Walters was yelling and creating a disruption during a critical roll call activity. Jones asserts that any force used was solely to restore order and extinguish Walters’s cigarette, and that Walters was simply instructed to comply. On the other hand, Walters insists the only provocation for any confrontation was his attempt to light a cigarette. Walters denies the existence of a significant disturbance, suggesting that he was targeted unjustly and that his thumb injury and emotional distress were both real and substantial.

 In support of Jones, it is argued that precedent such as Whitley v. Albers and Hudson v. McMillian requires an assessment of whether the force used was de minimis. Proponents for Jones emphasize that absent clear evidence of more than minor harm, no excessive force violation can be found under the Eighth Amendment. They stress that medical records showed no documented injury and that Walters’s allegations of persistent thumb problems were unsupported by verifiable treatment requests. Citing decisions interpreting the Eighth Amendment, they maintain that force legitimately used to quell a disturbance is permissible, and that any claimed injury here was too insubstantial to violate constitutional standards.

 In support of Walters, it is argued that a person need not demonstrate significant physical wounds to prove that the force used was cruel and unusual. Referencing Hudson v. McMillian, the position is that force inflicted maliciously or sadistically violates the Eighth Amendment, regardless of whether the resulting harm is labeled de minimis. Walters’s assertions of fear and psychological harm are presented as evidence that the painful and deliberate strikes caused intangible injuries beyond minor physical manifestations. In addition, it is contended that the threat to stab Walters with the keys, combined with multiple swings at his face, proves that the force exceeded any reasonable measure to restore order, thus undercutting any claim that it was merely a routine or trivial incident.
