You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Ridge Waves Corporation owns and operates a 100,000-watt radio station (WJCC-FM), identified on air as “Energy 101.” WJCC-FM is licensed to Bartlett City, North Carolina, with its broadcast tower located in Brooks Town, North Carolina. Because Brooks Town is only a few miles from the border between North Carolina and Virginia, Energy 101’s signal reaches large portions of both states. Corporate offices for Ridge Waves Corporation are in Ashton Coast, Virginia, and the station regularly announces itself as broadcasting from both Bartlett City, North Carolina, and Ashton Coast, Virginia. 

 According to estimates, approximately 92.2% of Energy 101’s audience resides in Virginia, with 7.8% residing in North Carolina. Despite that, the station’s license is tied to North Carolina, which has laws prohibiting lotteries. By contrast, Virginia operates a state-run lottery. Ridge Waves Corporation’s advertising revenues largely come from Virginia-based businesses and include interest from purchasers of lottery advertising. Ridge Waves Corporation has refrained from airing Virginia lottery advertisements, citing concerns about potential violations of federal law.

 The federal statutes invoked—18 U.S.C. §§ 1304 and 1307—prohibit lottery advertising by stations licensed to locations in non-lottery states and expose violating licensees to possible sanctions by the Federal Communications Commission. While 18 U.S.C. § 1307 permits such advertising by stations licensed to lottery states or states adjacent to them that also permit lotteries, Ridge Waves Corporation does not qualify for that exemption because its station is specifically licensed to North Carolina. The company brought the present legal challenge after concluding that these restrictions interfere with its desire to broadcast Virginia lottery advertisements.

 Ridge Waves Corporation contends that, because Virginia’s lottery is legal within Virginia, federal restrictions that forbid such advertising on Energy 101 in North Carolina violate principles guarding commercial speech. The corporation cites Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, arguing that their lottery ads involve lawful and non-misleading speech that should be protected. Ridge Waves Corporation points out that the station’s audience is overwhelmingly in a state with a legal lottery, making the prohibition counter to the principle that truthful information about a lawful product should not be blocked merely because a small portion of the audience is in a place where the product is illegal. They invoke precedents such as Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Council to emphasize that only a substantial government interest, narrowly served, can justify limiting truthful commercial speech. They also argue that, given the prevalence of Virginia lottery advertisements on nearby television, radio, and newspapers, any prohibition specifically targeting Energy 101 has little practical effect, and thus does not satisfy applicable standards for restricting commercial messages.

 The Federal Communications Commission stresses that 18 U.S.C. §§ 1304 and 1307 were enacted to protect each state’s prerogative to adopt or reject lotteries as part of its policy on gambling. The Commission underscores that North Carolina has chosen not to allow lotteries and notes that the station’s license is formally associated with that state’s legal regime, despite the station’s listenership being chiefly in Virginia. Under this view, the federal statutes properly distinguish between stations licensed to lottery states and stations licensed elsewhere, and the Commission argues that this distinction supports the underlying purpose of honoring each state’s position on lotteries. The Commission cites Board of Trustees of the State University of New York v. Fox to assert that the law need not use the least restrictive means if it directly advances a substantial government interest. The Commission maintains that the prohibition here directly supports non-lottery states’ policy choices, which require a clear and predictable regulatory boundary to avoid undermining any state’s decision against legalizing gambling.
