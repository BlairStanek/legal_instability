You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Rivera Rivera is a citizen of Mexico who was admitted to the United States as a permanent resident in late 1985. In the following year, he was convicted of transporting a controlled substance, which qualified as an aggravated felony. Afterward, he was deported to Mexico. Some years later, he returned to the United States without having sought or received any formal permission from federal authorities to reenter.

 At the time of the deportation that is central to this case, a hearing was held by telephone, with the presiding officer in Park Heights and both Rivera Rivera and his lawyer, Morales, in Brookvale. The interpreter was stationed in Park Heights. Only some preliminary questions were relayed in Spanish, and most other parts of the hearing were not interpreted for Rivera Rivera. It is undisputed that, during this telephonic proceeding, the lawyer answered several combined questions on behalf of Rivera Rivera, including the waiver of certain procedural rights. There is no indication in the record that Rivera Rivera was asked personally about waiving his physical presence at the hearing.

 After the deportation, Rivera Rivera made no application for any formal adjustment of status. When he was found again in Redview, Arizona, federal authorities brought charges under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2). During the trial, he attempted to introduce evidence that he had a resident identification card issued on the date of his original lawful admission. He contended this card gave him a reasonable belief that he possessed permission to reenter. The district court granted a request by the Government to exclude that evidence from being presented at trial.

 For its position, the Government relies on the notion that the relevant statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1326, does not require specific intent. It maintains that a defendant can be found in violation of the statute if the defendant is an alien who was deported and later reentered without formal authorization. The Government emphasizes that, even if there were irregularities in the deportation process, a subsequent challenge to its validity must demonstrate actual prejudice—namely, that the outcome of the earlier proceeding could have been different but for the alleged errors. The Government cites established precedent for the principle that possessing an identification card or believing one has permission to return is not itself a defense to the charge of illegal reentry. It further asserts that any procedural defects, such as a telephonic hearing or incomplete translation, are not alone sufficient to undermine the use of the deportation order if there is no concrete showing that these defects had a real and substantive impact on the final determination to deport.

 In challenging the case against him, Rivera Rivera argues that the telephonic hearing, conducted without personal participation in all material respects, amounted to a breakdown of due process because it was not adequately translated and there was no direct confirmation that he waived his right to be physically present. He emphasizes that these procedural irregularities undermine the reliability of the deportation order. Rivera Rivera also argues that when a person genuinely believes, based on possession of a long-standing resident identification card or other indications, that reentry was permissible, this should preclude criminal liability. He points to decisions in which courts in at least one jurisdiction have recognized a reasonableness element in understanding whether prior consent to reenter existed. He further contends that even if some prejudice requirement applies, the defects here were so pervasive—affecting the structural integrity of the hearing itself—that requiring a further showing of prejudice is inappropriate.
