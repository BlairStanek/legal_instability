You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Officers from a local police department in Oregon directed their attention to Sam Green after learning he had recently been in one Oregon city, where several burglaries had taken place. According to records, Sam Green had also frequented another Oregon city, conducting multiple pawn transactions. Notably, when officers in that second city arrested him on outstanding warrants, he was soon released without the investigating officers’ knowledge. Subsequently, members of the same local police department discovered that Sam Green had returned to a motel in the first city, the same area where the earlier burglaries had happened.

 On the relevant date, officers arrived at the motel, where Sam Green was believed to be staying. The officers had probable cause to arrest him on suspicion of receiving stolen property, given the items he had pawned. The officers approached his room wearing uniforms and with weapons holstered. They knocked, and Sam Green opened his door while standing just inside the threshold of the room. At that moment, the officers confirmed his identity, took him into custody, and requested permission to search the room. He consented, both orally and in writing. During the search, they found a firearm in the closet, consistent with Sam Green’s acknowledgement of its presence there.

 There was later disagreement over whether the arrest, made without a warrant, was permissible. The questions focused on whether Sam Green’s act of opening the door exposed him to arrest without the same protections required inside a home or lodging. Various details were noted: Sam Green had looked out his window at the uniformed officers before opening the door, the officers did not force entry or use a ruse, and they stood outside the room’s threshold until the arrest was effected. Following the arrest and discovery of the firearm, charges were brought against Sam Green for unlawful possession of a firearm by a person with a felony record.

 In support of the first party’s position, arguments emphasize longstanding precedent that a person who voluntarily opens the door to uniformed officers may be viewed as presenting himself in a quasi-public context. These arguments draw upon holdings in cases such as United States v. Santana and United States v. Botero, which address whether someone, by coming to the doorway, surrenders certain privacy protections. The first party points out that no force, threats, or deception were used, suggesting that Sam Green assumed the risk of a public encounter by choosing to respond and unlock the door. They argue that the Fourth Amendment typically prohibits warrantless entry, but that such prohibitions may not apply when the occupant has effectively consented to contact at a location comparable to a public vantage point. They also rely on the notion that probable cause supports a valid arrest under United States v. Watson when it occurs in a place where privacy rights are diminished.

 In defense of the second party, arguments rest heavily on the protections of the Fourth Amendment and the principle, established in Payton v. New York, that absent a warrant or exigent circumstances, an arrest inside a suspect’s home or private space is presumptively unreasonable. They contend that standing even inches within one’s private dwelling does not equate to being in a fully public setting, so the individual should not be liable to warrantless seizure. They further rely on precedents like United States v. Johnson, which emphasize that merely answering a knock at the door does not amount to surrendering privacy rights inside the home. The argument underscores that allowing officers to effect a warrantless arrest solely because the door has been opened, without overt consent to enter, would erode the Constitution’s protection against unauthorized home intrusion.
