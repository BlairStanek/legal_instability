You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this matter, multiple individuals were arrested after authorities conducted a search and discovered a large quantity of counterfeit identification items. These items included a collection of Social Security cards, blank alien registration cards, and blank temporary resident cards. According to evidence put forward, these individuals used various kinds of equipment to manufacture the false documents. No dispute existed over whether the individuals had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to produce false identification documents.

 The authorities and the individuals disputed how best to calculate the number of “sets” or groupings of documents for sentencing purposes. The individuals contended that only the Social Security cards paired with other papers should count as full “sets.” The authorities suggested that even a single piece of identification could be treated as its own “set,” which would greatly affect the total number of sets for sentencing.

 A central point of discussion was the volume of counterfeit documents seized. Beyond the Social Security cards that were obviously matched with other pieces, scores of additional blank cards were also discovered. Within this context, the question arose whether and how incomplete or unmatched documents should be counted in the total for sentencing. The dispute focused on the significance of the term “set” and to what extent that term should account for the unpaired documents.

 The individuals’ arguments emphasized that the language of the relevant guideline is clear in referring to a specific threshold for “sets” of documents, rather than single pieces. They cited the ordinary meaning of the term “set,” along with related dictionary definitions, to argue that a set must consist of multiple items intended for use together. They also pointed out that relevant legal sources, such as the commentary in the guidelines, ought not contradict the natural reading of the guideline’s text. They argued that if one considered single documents to be separate sets, that would effectively change the guideline’s wording from “sets of documents” to “documents.” They further highlighted certain statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. § 1028, and the Sentencing Reform Act, as supporting a straightforward reading of the guideline’s language and emphasizing clarity about how documents are counted.

 The Government’s arguments stressed the purpose behind the guidelines and statutes, particularly 18 U.S.C. § 1028, which focuses on how many people could potentially be given fraudulent access to identification. In this view, any group of documents, even if not perfectly matched, could supply someone with fake identification. The Government referred to the statutory definitions describing an identification document as something that authorizes or represents a single person. From this perspective, whether one item or multiple items are used, each still represents the ability to furnish a discrete individual with false credentials. They also invoked the text of the guidelines’ commentary to suggest that “set” can include all possible ways to create identification, so the number of potential end-users should be central to deciding how many sets exist.
