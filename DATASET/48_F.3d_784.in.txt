You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, Alex Parker arrived at the Mapleton Facility in Mapleton, Virginia, intending to visit someone incarcerated there. Signs around the visitor area warned that introducing contraband was prohibited. After he entered a room designated for searching visitors, Officer Rowe and Officer Baker conducted a routine pat-down of Alex Parker’s clothing. The search caused Officer Rowe to suspect that Alex Parker might have a foreign object near his groin area. During questioning, Alex Parker moved his hand into his pants and transferred something into his mouth. Officer Baker attempted to force the object out of Alex Parker’s mouth, believing it to be contraband. Moments later, Alex Parker spit out bubble gum. A physical struggle followed, with Alex Parker biting Officer Baker’s thumb and holding the bite for several seconds. Other personnel entered to assist, and Officer Hayes, trying to restrain Alex Parker, was also bitten when her arm came near Alex Parker’s mouth.

 After these events, personnel at the Mapleton Facility observed that Alex Parker lost consciousness intermittently, prompting concerns he might have swallowed narcotics. He was taken to Smith Medical Center for further evaluation. While there, Alex Parker displayed combative behavior, including attempts to bite and spit at medical staff. There was testimony that Alex Parker threatened to infect those around him once they mentioned he was HIV positive. Laboratory tests showed narcotics in his system, and an additional search of his automobile revealed multiple balloons containing various illicit substances.

 At trial, the prosecution presented medical records referencing Alex Parker’s HIV positive status and statements suggesting he was aware of that status before the events in question. A medical expert, Dr. James Carter, testified that HIV has been transmitted through bites, though such transmissions are not universally documented. Alex Parker denied any prior knowledge of his HIV status, insisting he was acting in self-defense when he bit the individuals involved. Both biting incidents caused substantial bleeding, and the officers underwent medical testing following the altercation.

 In advocating for Alex Parker’s conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 113(c) and D.C.Code § 22-505(b), one side argued that the evidence established the requisite intent to do bodily harm. They pointed to testimony describing continued aggressive behavior, including extended contact during each bite. They also emphasized case law, such as United States v. Moore and United States v. Johnson, indicating that a wide range of instruments or means can qualify as “dangerous weapons” when used to inflict or threaten serious injury. They noted authority like McLaughlin v. United States to argue that an item—or even a body part—may meet the statutory definition of a dangerous weapon based on its manner of use. They cited further examples, including United States v. Riggins, showing that seemingly innocuous objects become dangerous when employed in a manner likely to result in significant harm. This side highlighted expert testimony that HIV may be transmitted by biting and concluded that the alleged circumstances fit within the statutory provisions that enhance penalties when assaults involve a “dangerous weapon.” The same arguments held that self-defense claims were contradicted by Alex Parker’s threats and aggressive conduct toward correctional officers and medical personnel.

 In support of Alex Parker, the other side contended that teeth or other body parts do not commonly match the ordinary understanding of a “dangerous weapon” as required by 18 U.S.C. § 113(c) or D.C.Code § 22-505(b). They pointed to authority like Commonwealth v. Davis and People v. Van Diver, emphasizing that ordinary body parts lack the defining characteristics of a weapon, and that broadening the term “weapon” to include a person’s teeth undermines the statutory structure distinguishing simple assault from assault with a dangerous weapon. In referencing similar reasoning, they observed that the legislative intent behind such statutes typically focuses on external instruments. They further argued that the evidence showed Alex Parker did not have knowledge of his HIV status, that he was reacting defensively when officers forcibly tried to remove an item from his mouth, and that he only bit the officers amidst a chaotic struggle. This perspective used these points to assert that the conduct did not fall within the enhanced-penalty provisions requiring proof of a dangerous weapon, urging that the biting amounted to a less severe form of assault and not an aggravated offense.
