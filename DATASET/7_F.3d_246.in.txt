You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Several individuals living in the United States without legal authorization, together with a group of intermediary organizations, brought a legal action against officials asserting that certain regulations under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) were being interpreted in a way that unlawfully prevented these individuals from obtaining the special, one-time opportunity to adjust their status. The primary dispute arose over whether these regulations, specifically those related to the phrase “known to the government,” were being enforced in a manner that deprived the individuals of the ability to apply for amnesty. In support of their position, various intermediary organizations—certified by the government to assist applicants—maintained that many would-be applicants were discouraged from seeking legalization or were effectively turned away.

 The lawsuit was brought in the district court, where the individuals and the organizations claimed that the process implemented by federal authorities imposed barriers beyond those intended by IRCA. They argued that officials had either misapplied or misrepresented the rules, thereby misleading many individuals into missing the statutory filing deadline for legalization. The district court appointed special masters to collect evidence from people who said they had been dissuaded or had been unable to file their applications. Numerous submissions were collected, describing interactions with government offices and the intermediary organizations.

 During the litigation, attention centered on two main factual issues. First, there were allegations that certain local offices had refused to accept completed applications or had explicitly advised potential applicants that they were not eligible, even though they wished to apply. This practice was colloquially called “front-desking.” Second, some individuals said they refrained from applying because they had been told—by either government personnel or intermediary organizations—of a supposed policy or regulation indicating that a lack of specific documents in government files disqualified them. The organizations also pointed to official guidance and manuals that they believed led to incorrect refusals or misstatements. Meanwhile, government officials observed that no centralized practice existed to refuse applications based on “known to the government” criteria, and they maintained that people could submit paperwork if they chose.

 In support of Jordan Fowler’s position, it was argued that IRCA’s text and structure prescribe an exclusive pathway for challenges to legalization decisions, requiring that any dispute be pursued in accordance with the statute’s requirement that individuals first apply, receive a determination, and, if denied, then seek review according to 8 U.S.C. § 1255a(f)(1). The argument emphasized Congress’s choice to limit the district court’s role in order to streamline amnesty proceedings and to direct substantive interpretation disputes into a single, coherent channel of review. Officials pointed to IRCA’s finality provisions, which specify judicial scrutiny of deportation orders in the appeals courts under 8 U.S.C. § 1255a(f)(4)(A), viewing that as the definitive mechanism for aliens to challenge adverse determinations. By referencing precedents interpreting administrative review processes under related immigration laws, Jordan Fowler’s side maintained that these procedures adequately protect individuals’ rights while ensuring consistent adjudication. The position further stressed that, under principles of ripeness, a claim must be based on an actual denial of an application rather than on speculative harms. According to them, without a formal rejection and a resulting record, courts may lack the concrete facts needed to evaluate whether the agency’s views about “known to the government” are consistent with IRCA.

 In support of Harbor Support, Inc.’s position, it was argued that the statutory framework does not foreclose immediate judicial intervention when systematic barriers prevent meaningful filing or a fair hearing of legalization requests. They contended that IRCA never intended to leave individuals without any timely remedy, especially if agency actions—like discouraging or turning away applicants at local offices—meant that potential class members would never reach the stage of a formal denial and deportation order. They invoked legal precedents asserting that constitutional and procedural challenges are distinct from routine administrative disagreements and are not necessarily subject to the same jurisdictional limits. Harbor Support, Inc. insisted that if the administrative scheme functioned in such a way that no record would ever be assembled—for example, if someone was denied even the chance to apply—then district courts had authority to ensure that the statutory promise of amnesty was properly available. They also drew on principles of fairness, pointing out that forcing individuals to surrender for deportation as a prerequisite to judicial review risked exposing them to irreparable harm. By citing relevant cases in which federal courts permitted broader statutory interpretation claims outside strict agency channels, Harbor Support, Inc. argued that the ongoing practical hurdles made direct district court relief appropriate.
