You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Horvath Telecom is a smaller interexchange carrier that provides long-distance services to businesses and payphone providers. Through presubscription, a business or payphone provider designates one carrier for its long-distance calls to route automatically. When a caller with a proprietary calling card from a large carrier such as Danville Telecom (formerly “AT & T”) places a “0+” call on a line presubscribed to Horvath Telecom, Horvath Telecom cannot validate the proprietary card number because that database is unavailable to it. Instead, Horvath Telecom reroutes these calls to the local exchange carrier in the hope that they will then travel to Danville Telecom’s network.

 Horvath Telecom claimed to incur substantial monthly costs in performing these reroutes. Because governmental regulations prohibit charging the cardholders themselves for these transfer expenses, Horvath Telecom created a proposed tariff designed to charge any large carrier that withheld its proprietary database for each call that ended up being routed in this manner.

 Horvath Telecom asserted that it was effectively compelled to move these calls along rather than refuse them, since refusing the calls risked alienating customers and damaging Horvath Telecom’s reputation with its payphone-provider and business clients. Although some large carriers apparently encouraged their cardholders to “dial around” smaller carriers in other ways, Danville Telecom had not, at the relevant time, advised its cardholders effectively. From Horvath Telecom’s perspective, this situation forced it to shoulder the expenses and operational complications connected to the calls.

 In support of its position, the Federal Communications Commission has maintained that any interstate communications charge must satisfy statutory justness and reasonableness obligations under section 201 of the Communications Act. It has referred to long-standing principles that a tariff filing serves as an offer of terms and conditions, where services should be requested affirmatively by a paying customer. According to the Commission, the regulatory framework (including its own rules governing clarity and correctness of filed tariffs) bars collecting fees from an entity that did not order the service. This stance draws upon established precedent in which carriers must clearly identify who is responsible for the tariffed service and must confirm that charges reflect requested and completed services. The Commission has also pointed to formal requirements that a proposed tariff avoid ambiguity, contending that carriers should not be permitted to impose verification burdens on the entities they name as customers unless plainly authorized under Commission policy. With these arguments, the Commission has invoked its statutory power to assess whether a proposed practice is genuinely voluntary, clearly disclosed, and consistent with the Communications Act’s “just and reasonable” standard.

 In turn, Horvath Telecom has argued that basic fairness and the Communications Act’s own structure should allow recovery for forced handling of long-distance calls. In its view, when a carrier such as Danville Telecom both withholds validation database access and fails to educate its cardholders to avoid “0+” calls on rivals’ lines, it effectively compels Horvath Telecom to furnish a transfer service that the larger carrier has “constructively ordered.” Horvath Telecom contends that absent a mechanism to bill Danville Telecom for these repeated reroutes, it faces an unfair financial drain imposed by the latter’s proprietary calling card practices. Moreover, Horvath Telecom asserts that the statute, as well as prior decisions acknowledging “constructive ordering,” should protect smaller carriers from absorbing the costs triggered by another carrier’s refusal to provide cooperation or instructions. Thus, Horvath Telecom characterizes its tariff not as an unlawful imposition of charges on a non-requesting party, but instead as a reasonable remedy to recoup unavoidable expenses in circumstances created by another carrier’s choices.
