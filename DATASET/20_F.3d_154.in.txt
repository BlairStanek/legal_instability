You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alice Matthews brought a claim after her spouse, Ethan Matthews, suffered a fatal fall from an offshore work area. This accident occurred on a fixed structure under the control of YellowStone Energy, Inc. off the coast of Louisiana. Ethan Matthews was employed by Lighthouse Drilling Services, which had been hired to perform certain drilling-related activities on the structure. Alice Matthews also acted on behalf of her minor child, Chase Matthews.

 Lighthouse Drilling Services placed its equipment on the outboard edge of YellowStone Energy, Inc.’s structure so that part of the drilling assembly projected beyond the existing safety rails. The added workspace was situated above the existing deck, creating a higher-level work area with some components extending outboard. The rig included a traction motor that required periodic inspections and repairs; the location of its access panel faced outward over the water. Responsibility for planning and approving this placement had been shared in some form between Lighthouse Drilling Services and YellowStone Energy, Inc.

 After approximately one month of operating at the site, the traction motor began emitting smoke. Ethan Matthews and Henry Rivera, both working for Lighthouse Drilling Services, were tasked with removing a blower motor atop the rig and inspecting the traction motor’s interior. While they attempted to loosen and lift the blower motor, it became free more abruptly than expected. In the process, Ethan Matthews lost his balance near the outboard edge of the elevated work zone and fell into the water below, sustaining fatal injuries. Clarkson Engineering Co., which had manufactured certain rig components, also appeared in some legal filings but was subsequently released.

 One line of argument underscores that YellowStone Energy, Inc. allegedly owed a specific duty of care to keep the location safe for those working on its structure, invoking Louisiana Civil Code article 2315. It cites that owners or operators of similar facilities are obliged to ensure reasonably secure conditions, including compliance with federal workplace safety regulations such as 33 C.F.R. § 142.4 and 33 C.F.R. § 143.110. These rules require that known hazards be remedied and that guardrails or barriers protect all normally occupied work zones. Relevant precedents are said to support the idea that a platform owner must take measures, or confirm that measures are taken, to avert recognized dangers. By expressly approving or authorizing the manner in which the projected workspace was set up, YellowStone Energy, Inc. is argued to have become directly responsible for ensuring that the altered layout still included proper guardrails and adequate access to all elevated components. In this view, the expansion of the deck area and addition of equipment atop the rails created newly occupied workspaces that needed equivalent safety protections.

 A contrasting argument posits that Lighthouse Drilling Services bore the primary responsibility for providing safe equipment and a safe method of work, especially since the entirety of the drilling apparatus belonged to and was operated by Lighthouse Drilling Services. Emphasis is placed on the principle that under Louisiana law, a principal generally is not liable for the independent contractor’s acts unless it retains operational control or specifically directs the unsafe method. Various cases are invoked to illustrate that mere knowledge of potential hazards or the routine practice of approving an independent contractor’s plan is insufficient to create a direct duty. The argument further stresses that federal regulations do not automatically convert a platform owner into a guarantor of an independent contractor’s apparatus. In this view, since Lighthouse Drilling Services both owned the rig and performed the work, all direct responsibilities for securing the elevated areas and installing guardrails or harnesses would rest with that contractor, rather than with YellowStone Energy, Inc.
