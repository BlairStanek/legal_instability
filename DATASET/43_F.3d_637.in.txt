You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Mr. Remington once worked for XYZ Catering, performing duties that involved offshore sites. He injured his shoulder at work, resulting in a compensation claim under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. After negotiations with DEF Insurance, a settlement provided Mr. Remington with $10,000 immediately and structured payments through an annuity purchased from GHI Annuities. This settlement was approved as an Award, and it specified future lump sums and monthly payments over a twenty-year period.

 About seven years later, Mr. Remington obtained an $85,000 loan from Alpha Financial to fund a venture operating a Coastal Hardware Store. In securing this loan, he executed an assignment of his interests in the annuity payments to Alpha Financial. For a time, Alpha Financial received the monthly installments directly from GHI Annuities, as arranged. However, when Mr. Remington’s store faltered, he redirected these payments to himself. Litigation ensued, leading a court in Rockdale County, Alabama, to issue a garnishment order directing GHI Annuities to resume paying Alpha Financial.

 Mr. Remington then filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, claiming the annuity payments as exempt property. Alpha Financial did not file an objection to this exemption within the bankruptcy rules’ deadline. Nonetheless, it continued to receive payments through the garnishment order. Mr. Remington brought an adversary proceeding to declare the annuity payments exempt. Central to the dispute was whether any anti-assignment provision under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act applied to the annuity, and whether Alpha Financial’s failure to contest the exemption promptly barred it from asserting an interest in those funds.

 In support of Alpha Financial’s position, it was argued that Mr. Remington had already received his full compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, which included creation of the annuity as part of the total settlement. Under this reasoning, the $170,000 annuity plus the earlier $10,000 cash payment equaled the complete award, meaning those funds were effectively paid and no longer fell within any statutory prohibition on assignment. Alpha Financial’s argument relied on language interpreted from 33 U.S.C. § 916, comparing the situation to precedents in which once compensation is paid to the recipient, he or she may freely use or pledge it. Alpha Financial also stressed that it was a secured creditor with a consensual lien on the right to receive payments, contending that a later bankruptcy filing could not invalidate that lien if the debtor had already divested himself of ownership in the assigned property. Reference was made to cases such as McIntosh v. Aubrey and Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers’ Nat’l Pension Fund for analogies on when benefits are deemed “paid,” asserting that a recipient is free to transfer or assign the sums.

 In support of Mr. Remington’s position, it was argued that the structured nature of the annuity meant he was still in the process of receiving compensation “due or payable” under the Act. Because DEF Insurance remained the annuity’s owner, and Mr. Remington was merely an intended beneficiary of the contract with GHI Annuities, he never fully possessed those proceeds in a way that would allow free assignment. By analogy to In Re Delgado, an anti-assignment provision was presented as something that complies not only when benefits are pending but even when they have been distributed in structured form. Mr. Remington’s position emphasized that 33 U.S.C. § 916 includes broad language invalidating any assignment of these compensation payments and stressed that courts should interpret the Act in a way that maintains protection for injured workers. The argument highlighted the risk to lenders in accepting collateral derived from benefits intending to remain exempt, suggesting that once a lender knowingly takes such collateral, it does so subject to any statutory restrictions prohibiting the transfer.
