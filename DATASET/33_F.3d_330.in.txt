You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, Patricia Green discovered changes in her breasts in the course of annual medical examinations for an ongoing, benign condition that she had first been diagnosed with many years before the events in dispute. Shortly before the date on which her new health coverage was to take effect, her doctor identified a palpable area in one of her breasts that had changed more than it had in previous years. Because of these changes, the doctor suggested further evaluation, though the doctor did not then diagnose any malignancy.

 On the day Patricia Green’s health coverage began, she visited a different physician for a follow-up check. The physician’s initial impression likewise was that the area was benign, but, partly for preventive reasons, ordered additional medical tests to rule out more serious conditions. A mammogram did not detect any malignancy, but, shortly afterward, the physician recommended a biopsy to be absolutely certain of the nature of the area in question.

 The biopsy, performed after coverage began, detected a malignant tumor that had been concealed by the benign breast condition. Because of this discovery, Patricia Green underwent further treatment to address the malignancy. Patricia and John Green then sought benefits under the insurance policy that had taken effect only a short time before the biopsy. Sunrise National Insurance and Arrowhead Health declined to provide payment for the costs related to treating the cancer, citing an exclusion for preexisting conditions discovered or treated in the period preceding the policy’s effective date.

 Sunrise National Insurance and Arrowhead Health assert several strong reasons why coverage for Patricia Green’s cancer claim should be denied. First, they rely on policy language indicating that any illness amounting to a bodily disturbance—causing physical changes and likely to deteriorate an individual’s health if untreated—is excluded from coverage if it had been the subject of medical attention prior to coverage. The companies read “medical attention” broadly, emphasizing that examinations for a suspicious area, even if believed benign at the time, represent services directed—at least in part—toward that undiscovered malignancy. The companies also invoke precedents indicating that a condition can exist, for policy-exclusion purposes, regardless of whether it is correctly diagnosed. Because the disputed area physically existed and was examined before coverage began, the companies maintain that the cancer’s presence was effectively addressed by a physician, even if unknowingly. They further underscore established federal case law holding that definitions within an insurance plan must be enforced according to plain meaning, even when circumstances produce a harsh outcome for the insured.

 Patricia and John Green present strong reasons why cancer treatment should be covered under their policy. They contend that the examinations prior to coverage were directed strictly at a benign condition with which Patricia Green had long been diagnosed, and had no causal or associative relationship to the malignancy. They argue that because neither the patient nor her doctors received any indication of cancer prior to coverage, the preexisting-illness clause is inapplicable. They point out that the policy language should be read to require that a genuine “disturbance” and its “medical attention” must be specific to the actual illness in dispute—here, cancer. Thus, they maintain that only a known or reasonably suspected malignancy would satisfy the policy’s exclusion, not a checkup for an unrelated benign condition. In support, they draw on decisions suggesting that an insurance policy’s definition of “preexisting” should not bar coverage for maladies discovered or diagnosed only after the policy has already begun, especially where the individual had no awareness of a serious underlying illness. They further argue that a contrary reading risks penalizing individuals who undergo proactive or preventive care, since any routine health screening could potentially exclude coverage if it happened to uncover a hidden illness.
