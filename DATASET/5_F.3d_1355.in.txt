You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this dispute, Clearfield County sought to impose an ad valorem property tax on certain parcels of land located within the Greenwood Settlement. The Greenwood Community, who had reacquired these parcels, objected that no such taxation should apply. The land in question had at one time been assigned or allotted under authority stemming from a treaty, and fee patents had issued with restrictions on alienation. Over time, these restrictions were lifted for specific individuals. Subsequently, ownership of these parcels passed out of the Greenwood Community’s control before the Community later purchased the parcels in fee status.

 One of the disputed parcels originated in an assignment to an individual here called Richard Maple. After his death, the parcel was inherited by various relatives and ultimately ended up with a non-member before the Greenwood Community reacquired it. Additional parcels stemmed from an assignment to someone called Darren Snow. Once the federal government declared him competent, any restrictions on alienation expired. Later, the Greenwood Community bought those parcels from private owners, also in fee status. Clearfield County proceeded to tax the land on the grounds that once alienation restrictions were removed, the land was subject to the same property taxation as other fee land in the area. In response, the Greenwood Community argued that the land, being part of the Greenwood Settlement, should remain free from state taxation.

 The Greenwood Community cited the land’s original designation under treaty mechanisms, the inherent sovereign status of their settlement, and an existing federal statute commonly called the Indian Nonintercourse Act. They maintained that the reacquired nature of these parcels meant that any power of alienation was re-restricted as a core principle of federal Indian policy. Clearfield County maintained that once the federal government lifted barriers to alienation, no subsequent reacquisition could reinstate such barriers—for purposes of property taxation—absent explicit federal authorization.

 Those supporting Clearfield County’s position contend that key federal statutes, including the General Allotment Act, indicate Congress’s intent for fee-patented land to be subject to applicable state taxes once alienation restrictions lapse. Referencing precedents like Goudy v. Meath, they argue that alienable land is presumed taxable unless clearly exempted by statute. They emphasize that once the federal government has made the land freely alienable or issued a certificate of competency to individuals, nothing in federal law automatically reinstates any tax immunity should a tribal entity later reacquire that land. These advocates also highlight provisions allowing the federal government to accept voluntarily conveyed trust properties, suggesting that if the Greenwood Community wanted immunity, they could seek to have the parcels placed in trust. Because such a process exists yet was not pursued, Clearfield County contends that the parcels remain alienable and thus taxed in the same manner as other unrestricted land.

 Those supporting the Greenwood Community’s position point to strong historical canons disfavoring state taxation of tribal lands absent a clear congressional directive. Drawing from language in cases that emphasize the need for “unmistakably clear” authorization, they argue that the mere lifting of alienation restrictions for private individuals should not override fundamental treaty rights or the protective scope of the Indian Nonintercourse Act. They claim that once the Greenwood Community reacquires the parcels, the core federal policy of safeguarding tribal-held land from state encumbrances reignites, whether or not it was once in alienable status. They also invoke historical precedents involving tribal lands reacquired by other communities, contending that the core purpose of federal protection—preventing tribes from being vulnerable to outside pressures—fully applies whenever the tribe itself holds the land. Thus, they maintain, without explicit statutory language re-imposing state taxation on such parcels, none should exist.
