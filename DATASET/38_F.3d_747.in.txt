You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jay Carter was charged under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) for allegedly robbing a branch of Crescent Bank, located in Amber Plaza on 500 East Redwood Lane in Clinton City. According to testimony, an individual wearing sunglasses and a hooded sweatshirt entered the bank, approached teller Terri Lane, and handed her a note demanding money. The note was written on the back of a memorandum from SummitSpray Systems, signed by Jonathan Davis. The teller turned over a substantial sum of money, and the individual departed, leaving behind the note. No usable fingerprints were recovered.

 Investigators learned that SummitSpray Systems employees had received copies of the memorandum around late September 1992. It was discovered that on the date of the alleged bank robbery, Jay Carter—an employee of SummitSpray Systems—was absent from work. Soon thereafter, Terri Lane picked Carter’s photograph from a lineup, although some uncertainty was noted. At one point, Carter faced charges on four counts of robbery involving different Crescent Bank locations; only one count ultimately proceeded to trial.

 A key witness, Chris Kelly, testified that he and Carter had known each other since childhood. Kelly recounted a conversation in which Carter allegedly described details of how to conduct a robbery swiftly, including instructions about specific bill denominations and wearing a hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses for concealment. During trial, the Government elicited testimony that Carter and Kelly used cocaine and heroin together, contending that this evidence demonstrated Carter’s financial needs. Carter argued that such testimony was unfairly prejudicial and did not establish any genuine financial motive. Additionally, Carter maintained that the overall evidence pointing to him as the robber was insufficient.

 Jay Carter’s position emphasized that the evidence tying him to the crime was speculative and unreliable. He highlighted unspecified doubts in the teller’s identification, noting that she expressed uncertainty when selecting his photo. He also challenged the reliability of Chris Kelly’s testimony on the ground that Kelly was obliged to testify as part of an agreement and offered vague statements under possibly compromised circumstances. Carter argued that references to his personal conduct outside the purview of the alleged robbery—particularly regarding drugs—were admitted in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). He contended that neither the frequency nor the extent of drug use demonstrated any financial pressure motivating a bank robbery. Citing cases that restrict the admissibility of character evidence, Carter asserted that such suggestions served only to paint him as a bad person rather than to prove any material fact.

 The Government maintained that the identification evidence was credible, pointing to the specific description of items used in the robbery and the teller’s ability to pick Carter from a photographic array. In addition, the Government noted the correlation between the demand note’s memorandum side and Carter’s employment at SummitSpray Systems. On the Rule 404(b) issue, the Government argued that a link existed between Carter’s alleged drug use and a plausible need for funds, making the testimony about narcotics use probative of his motive. The Government cited precedent permitting evidence of financial need, including the possibility of addiction, to explain why an individual might commit a crime involving the acquisition of money. Finally, the Government asserted that Kelly’s testimony provided an eyewitness account of Carter’s admissions, contending that the purported details about the robbery matched known facts of the offense.
