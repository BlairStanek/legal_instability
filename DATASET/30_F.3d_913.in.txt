You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Robin Lawson had worked as a teller at the Woodmont Branch of the Greenwood Lending Corporation in Greenvale, Indiana. She pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement of funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 656. The district court imposed a term of imprisonment, supervised release, community service, and restitution. She later challenged certain aspects of that punishment, focusing on whether her actions were subject to an enhanced penalty under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.

 According to the record, Robin Lawson began diverting funds that belonged to the Greenwood Lending Corporation. Terry Harmon, who was the manager at the Woodmont Branch, discovered this activity. Rather than halting it, Terry Harmon joined the embezzlement scheme and helped Robin Lawson expand it over a two-year period. They took cash from their teller drawers, withdrew amounts from the vault without proper accounting, and prepared fictitious documentation to hide the shortages. The total amount of misappropriated funds was substantial, and their methods became more intricate over time, involving false cashier’s checks, forged loan documents in the names of unsuspecting individuals, and a post office box set up to keep loan-related correspondence hidden from the institution’s main office.

 As part of the case, the district court assessed whether Robin Lawson’s specific role at the Woodmont Branch constituted a position of trust for purposes of sentencing. The record contains references to her responsibilities and the extent of her knowledge about internal bank procedures. There was testimony indicating she had significant freedom of action in reporting and accessing certain cash totals. It was also noted that Terry Harmon’s actions played a role in reducing external oversight. The question arose whether, from the standpoint of the Greenwood Lending Corporation, Robin Lawson’s status exceeded that of an ordinary teller and therefore permitted her to commit and hide the scheme more effectively.

 One argument is that an employee in Robin Lawson’s role should not automatically receive an enhanced penalty simply by virtue of being a teller. Under this view, the relevant sentencing guideline provision should not be applied if the job is largely routine or subject to typical bank controls. Supporters of this position point to language, including commentary in U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, suggesting that an “ordinary bank teller” does not fall within the guideline’s enhancement if the position is limited and supervised. They contend that, to avoid punishing defendants twice for the same underlying breach of trust, a court must find that the teller’s authority rose to a professional or managerial level of discretion beyond what the offense of embezzlement alone necessarily involves. Advocates of this argument often cite case law indicating that a mere opportunity to steal based on the trust inherent in a teller’s position does not suffice unless there is meaningful additional discretion or a reliance on the teller’s integrity that substantially eases the commission or concealment of the crime.

 The other argument is that Robin Lawson’s role did, in fact, place her in a position of trust that significantly aided the scheme. Proponents of this perspective rely on evidence that, thanks to her responsibilities and knowledge of internal systems, she helped produce false entries, manipulated vault logs, and facilitated fraudulent loans. They emphasize that full oversight apparently did not apply to her duties, and that she operated with enough autonomy to make the embezzlement difficult to detect. Under this reasoning, her level of access and specialized understanding, rather than the nominal title of “teller,” was the key factor. These supporters cite guidelines commentary and decisions allowing an enhancement when a defendant’s access, knowledge, or relative independence makes it easier both to commit theft and to conceal it. They further rely on precedent clarifying that, where a banking institution relies on personal integrity in ways that allow an employee to bypass ordinary controls, the individual holds a position of trust as contemplated by U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3.
