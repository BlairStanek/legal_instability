You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Blair worked at the Riverdale Childcare Facility and later at the Maple Grove Inn. While moving heavy furniture at the Maple Grove Inn, Blair felt immediate pain in her lower back, which led her to seek medical attention. She also had multiple health complaints including asthma, high blood pressure, heart trouble, and shortness of breath. Blair could read and write only minimally, and she received special education through about the ninth grade. She later underwent a psychological evaluation revealing an IQ score in the mid-60s.

 Multiple doctors assessed Blair over several years. One physician, Dr. Santos, reported that Blair had a congenital back condition affecting her sacroiliac joint, supported by X-rays from early 1981. Dr. Santos noted tenderness, numbness, and tingling that suggested a chronic situation. A chiropractor, who began treating Blair a few years after the alleged onset date, supported her claim of severe back problems. Dr. Wells evaluated Blair in the mid-1980s, believed she possibly had a long-term herniated disk, and questioned whether her earlier treatment had been appropriate. Throughout this time frame, Blair said her pain interfered with her daily activities: she needed frequent rest while doing housework, had difficulty walking even a short distance without stopping, and struggled with bending or stooping.

 The Secretary received these records and, through administrative proceedings, reviewed whether Blair’s conditions before the end of 1981 met the criteria for disability benefits. Blair asserted that her combined mental and physical conditions severely limited her ability to work, while opposing views suggested that certain examinations showed minimal abnormalities and that medications or treatments were in some respects effective. Conflicting reports arose about whether Blair’s back condition and other ailments significantly restricted her capacity for gainful activity.

 Blair’s strongest legal arguments highlight that she possesses an IQ in the range of 60 to 70, which she believes satisfies the mental component of a listed impairment. Under that standard, if an individual with such an IQ also has at least one additional physical or mental impairment that creates more than a slight or minimal limitation on basic work activities, she contends she is presumed to qualify for benefits. Blair cites guidelines explaining that the threshold for “significant” impairment merely requires demonstrating an effect on work performance beyond minor tasks, and she emphasizes medical records documenting back pain, congenital back anomalies, discomfort in performing physical tasks, and a variety of other conditions. Blair asserts these combined factors establish a clear basis for disability under the relevant regulations and decisions, insisting that showing a chronic back issue and reduced intellectual capacity is sufficient to meet the listing.

 In response, the Secretary’s strongest legal arguments are that Blair’s medical findings do not sufficiently prove a separate and significant impairment in addition to her IQ scores. While the Secretary recognizes Blair’s below-average intellectual functioning, the Secretary emphasizes case law and regulations requiring that any additional impairment place distinct and meaningful limits on work-related activities. The Secretary points to records describing Blair’s examinations as “unremarkable” or indicating that medications provided relief. From this standpoint, the Secretary argues that occasional or moderate symptoms and sporadic treatment do not necessarily compel a finding of meaningful functional limitation beyond any effects of her intellectual status, contending it remains uncertain whether the back condition or other alleged ailments rose to a level needed to establish the presumed disability under the listing criteria.
