You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On or about February 26, 1991, law enforcement officers arrived at a multi-unit residence in Riverton. They had a warrant to investigate alleged drug trafficking by Thomas Green, an eighteen-year-old student. Upon ringing the downstairs doorbell and asking for narcotics, officers conducted a transaction for two small packets of a controlled substance in the foyer. Immediately afterward, an officer attempted to seize Thomas Green, prompting him to flee upstairs and lock the door to his own room.

 When the officers broke into Thomas Green’s room, they found marked cash under his mattress and, alongside it, an unloaded shotgun. In a separate container under his bed, they discovered more money and multiple small packets of what the government believed to be cocaine. No ammunition was located in the residence. The government maintained that the firearm was kept as part of Thomas Green’s ongoing possession of narcotics intended for distribution, and it questioned why he would keep a shotgun nearby in connection with his activities.

 Thomas Green insisted that the shotgun did not belong to him but rather to a former acquaintance who had left it behind. He also stated that he was trying to keep the firearm hidden away from young relatives. The case raised considerations about whether the alleged conduct of Thomas Green—possessing both drugs and an unloaded firearm—constituted a form of “use” under criminal statutes that penalize firearms involvement in drug trafficking offenses. It further brought up discussion about whether the relatively small amount of drugs in question should influence the analysis of whether the presence of the gun was meant for defensive or protective purposes.

 According to the government’s position, the law allows for an expansive reading of “use” when a defendant has ready access to a firearm in connection with maintaining or safeguarding illegal drugs. The government has argued that an unloaded or inoperable weapon is still potentially dangerous and can serve as a deterrent or emboldening force in the context of narcotics activity. It has relied on precedents interpreting federal statutes—such as 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)—as broadly covering situations where a firearm, even if not fired or brandished, is kept to provide protection for drugs or drug proceeds. The government has pointed to other federal cases emphasizing that the presence and availability of a firearm in drug-related scenarios satisfies the legal requirement of “use,” especially if jurors can infer an underlying intent to facilitate or secure the drug operation.

 Thomas Green’s position stresses that “use” must entail more than mere possession, particularly in light of case law that interprets 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) to require some active employment or at least ready brandishing of the firearm. He contends that possession of an unloaded shotgun tucked away under a mattress—without ammunition or visible display—falls short of the necessary showing of facilitation. Thomas Green argues that mere proximity between the weapon and narcotics cannot be enough; rather, there must be evidence proving the firearm was intentionally positioned to advance or protect the drug offense. He points to decisions where courts have concluded that locked, stored, or otherwise inaccessible firearms do not cross the threshold into “use,” especially if the surrounding circumstances indicate only a theoretical, rather than actual, likelihood of employing the weapon in a drug crime.
