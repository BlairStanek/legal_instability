You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Several individuals connected with The Morgan Group brought a civil rights suit against certain city officials, alleging that officers of the Parkview Police Department in Clear Creek, California, used excessive force when they shot four suspects outside a fast-food restaurant, killing three and injuring one. One of the wounded suspect’s relatives and the estates of those who died joined in the litigation. Early in the trial, The Morgan Group served a subpoena ad testificandum on Logan West, an agent employed by the National Investigative Unit as part of a criminal investigation into the same shooting. Logan West was not present at the fast-food restaurant incident and was not a direct witness to the officers’ conduct.

 Logan West had gathered material during a federal inquiry, and The Morgan Group intended to question him about that evidence and his conclusions regarding the circumstances of the shooting. However, the National Department of Governance, after reviewing the matter, denied Logan West permission to testify based on 28 C.F.R. § 16.22(a), a provision implementing 5 U.S.C. § 301. Under this regulation, Logan West was directed to decline any demand for testimony concerning information acquired in the course of his official duties unless expressly approved by the appropriate agency official.

 When Logan West refused to answer questions before the district court, he was found in contempt. The district court then issued an order requiring Logan West to testify in open court, but again, he declined, citing the limitation imposed by the regulation. As a result, the district court imposed a second contempt order. The Morgan Group maintained that Logan West’s testimony was crucial to their case, while The United States supported Logan West’s reliance on the agency’s direction to withhold certain information.

 The United States relies on several primary arguments to support its position that Logan West was not obligated to comply with the subpoena. First, it emphasizes the text of 5 U.S.C. § 301, which permits heads of executive departments to prescribe regulations concerning the conduct of their employees, the distribution of the agency’s business, and the use of agency records. It argues that 28 C.F.R. § 16.22(a) was duly promulgated under this enabling authority and validly requires employees to obtain approval before disclosing information. It contends that precedent, including cases such as United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen and Boske v. Comingore, underlines the right of department heads to centralize and manage disclosure of governmental materials. This, The United States claims, is crucial for orderly administration, protection of sensitive materials, and proper invocation of privileges. Moreover, The United States argues that any challenge to decisions made under the regulation must be brought against the appropriate official, rather than through a contempt action against a subordinate who is bound by departmental rules.

 The Morgan Group counters that the district court’s power to compel evidence is an essential aspect of the judicial function, and no agency regulation may override the court’s duty to hear relevant testimony in a federal lawsuit. Highlighting the language in 5 U.S.C. § 301 that states it does not authorize withholding information from the public, The Morgan Group contends that the regulation exceeds its delegated authority if it effectively insulates witnesses from otherwise valid subpoenas. They invoke the principle that the judicial branch holds the authority to decide what evidence is admissible, pointing to longstanding rules that a party’s right to obtain vital proof should not be unilaterally curtailed by an internal executive branch policy. They assert that requiring an entirely separate action or administrative procedure to obtain permission from the agency head is impractical and undermines the subpoena power that traditionally compels witnesses to provide testimony needed for the fair resolution of cases.
