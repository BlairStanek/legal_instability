You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On July 31, 1992, law enforcement officials executed a search warrant at a boarding house located in Redwood, in the state of North Carolina. They reported finding Andrew Brown in a bedroom, where he allegedly possessed multiple small bags of cocaine and heroin, along with a substantial amount of currency. A 9mm pistol was located under a pillow on the bed in that same bedroom. Brown was also said to be carrying a key to the front door of the premises. In another part of the bedroom, further quantities of the same substances were found hidden in a radio.

 On September 19, 1992, the authorities executed another warrant at a different residence in Redwood reputed for frequent drug use. As they entered a back room where numerous people were gathered, Brown allegedly threw small bags of cocaine and heroin into the air and moved from a couch to a chair. Officers stated that they recovered more of the same drugs from Brown’s person, with additional bags scattered around the couch. A .22 caliber revolver was discovered beneath the couch cushions. Brown was not the documented owner or tenant of the residence, but a metal plate bearing the words “Sparrow’s Place” was found in the kitchen. Several individuals testified that Brown occasionally visited and kept some personal belongings there.

 As a result of these events, Brown was charged with counts including possession of narcotics with intent to distribute, use of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, and unlawful possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony. Brown moved before the district court to sever the charges related to the July 31 incident from those arising on September 19, contending that trying all counts together would unfairly prejudice him. The district court denied the motion. Brown also contested whether there was sufficient evidence to link him to the firearm found in the couch on September 19, arguing that he neither owned nor controlled it.

 Advocates for the United States have maintained that evidence of proximity to firearms during drug trafficking activities can establish “use” or constructive possession under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1). They point to precedents holding that actual handling of a weapon is not necessary when there is a clear connection facilitating drug activity. They also argue that dominion over a residence or presence in an area where illicit substances are packaged and distributed supports an inference of control over both the drugs and any firearms found there. According to these arguments, when a defendant is discovered with a large quantity of narcotics, a significant amount of currency, and a readily accessible firearm in the same location, there is enough to show that the weapon emboldened or safeguarded the drug trafficking operation. In addition, they contend that substantive links to the premises, such as having a key or personal effects in the location, bolster the conclusion that the defendant had the requisite dominion or control over any contraband found.

 Those supporting Andrew Brown assert that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) requires either actual or constructive possession, and the mere presence of a firearm in the general vicinity is insufficient. They rely on authority indicating that constructive possession must be anchored in a showing of ownership, dominion, or control over the weapon or the premises. They contend the gun beneath the couch cushions was hidden in such a way that Brown could not have easily accessed it. They further emphasize that occasional visits or minimal personal belongings in a house do not necessarily prove control over the entire premises. They also maintain that any sudden movements by Brown could as readily indicate a desire to distance himself from the drugs as from a firearm, making constructive possession of the weapon a matter of speculation rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
