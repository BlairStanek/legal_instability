You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Clarity, Inc. is in the business of sourcing and distributing products for fundraising campaigns, while Dawn LLC produces and procures various gift items and supplies them to different distributors, including Clarity, Inc. Both entities initially entered into a written supply contract under which Dawn LLC would package and ship merchandise directly to customers, receiving a percentage of the retail price for each product sold. Several years later, Dawn LLC sent a letter proposing to provide free prizes as an incentive for customers, and the supply arrangement was extended. During the same timeframe, the principal owner of Dawn LLC, Roger Hill, began searching for a corporate partner or possible investor, and discussions between Clarity, Inc. and Dawn LLC ensued about a potential business relationship beyond the existing supply contract.

 In the midst of these ongoing talks, Clarity, Inc. discovered that one of its other vendors, Cadence, was in financial distress. Clarity, Inc. asked Dawn LLC to step in and fulfill Cadence’s contractual obligations, agreeing to grant Dawn LLC a set payment per unit distributed. Dawn LLC proceeded to store Cadence’s remaining food and gift inventory, distribute the products, and provide additional prize promotions, believing that these tasks aligned with broader possibilities being discussed between the two organizations. Dawn LLC also invested in upgrades, including building cold storage capacity, enhancing computer capabilities, and hiring former Cadence employees, which it later claimed were undertaken in reliance on the possibility of a deeper business collaboration.

 Eventually, Dawn LLC took legal action against Clarity, Inc., setting forth multiple claims. Dawn LLC alleged generally that it had proceeded under a good-faith assumption of a larger corporate arrangement with Clarity, Inc. and sought damages based on an alleged oral contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, interference with prospective contractual relations, unjust enrichment, and conversion, among other issues. Clarity, Inc. maintained that any operational changes made by Dawn LLC arose solely from Dawn LLC’s desire to fulfill its separate and existing supply obligations or to improve its general capabilities, and that no binding arrangement beyond the preexisting supply contracts ever materialized.

 As to why Clarity, Inc. might prevail, it was argued that any new venture discussion was preliminary and never culminated in a fully binding agreement. Clarity, Inc. further contended that significant features of the alleged deal—such as a purchase price, exact structure of the corporate transaction, and essential deadlines—remained unsettled. Citing principles embodied in Wheeling Downs Racing Ass’n v. West Virginia Sportservice, Inc. and McGinnis v. Enslow, Clarity, Inc. highlighted that a valid meeting of the minds on fundamental terms is necessary for an enforceable contract. Clarity, Inc. also asserted that the West Virginia Statute of Frauds required a written instrument for the sale of securities in complex transactions and that no such writing existed. In addition, Clarity, Inc. maintained that Dawn LLC’s actions regarding cold storage, upgraded systems, and prize distributions were consistent with the existing supply contracts, thereby negating claims that any extra-contractual benefit was conferred without compensation.

 As to why Dawn LLC might prevail, it was argued that an oral agreement for Clarity, Inc. either to purchase a major stake or to form a joint venture existed, based on statements and conduct indicating much more than mere negotiation. Dawn LLC claimed it proceeded to fulfill Cadence’s obligations, invest in storage facilities, expand computing capabilities, and hire specialized staff—all because Dawn LLC believed the parties had forged a more extensive partnership. According to Dawn LLC, it was these actions, supposedly requested or encouraged by Clarity, Inc., that generated significant operational costs. Dawn LLC’s position relied on evidence suggesting repeated assurances from Clarity, Inc. that a broader business arrangement was “a done deal,” creating reliance beyond routine supply agreements. Moreover, Dawn LLC contended that enforcing strict application of the West Virginia Statute of Frauds would be inequitable under circumstances where Clarity, Inc. allegedly led Dawn LLC to believe the oral arrangement was finalized, thereby justifying Dawn LLC’s additional expenditures for the benefit of both parties.
