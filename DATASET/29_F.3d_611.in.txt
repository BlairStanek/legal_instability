You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A building project was initiated under a contract to supply an air conditioning system with the capability of delivering 900 tons of cooling capacity. Orion Construction Company submitted a bid that included a chiller using a high ozone-depleting refrigerant, though it could later be converted to a lower ozone-depleting alternative. Orion Construction Company proposed its system after being selected as the lowest bidder, and it delivered a system that was initially rated at 900 tons of cooling capacity while using the higher ozone-depleting refrigerant.

 Upon review, the Department of Veterans Affairs questioned whether the system, after conversion to the lower ozone-depleting refrigerant, would still meet the 900-ton capacity requirement. The Department of Veterans Affairs believed the contract required the 900-ton capacity both before and after the conversion. Orion Construction Company maintained that the contract did not explicitly require the 900-ton performance level after the system was converted, pointing to the wording that allowed an alternative path of initially using a higher ozone-depleting refrigerant as long as the system could be converted in the future.

 Orion Construction Company further asserted that it was not commercially feasible to achieve 900 tons post-conversion if the system was originally designed for a higher ozone-depleting refrigerant. The Department of Veterans Affairs, however, pointed to the contract drawings and clauses, emphasizing that performance requirements were based on the 900-ton baseline. In addition, discussions arose concerning whether prospective bidders should have sought clarification if there was any confusion regarding the performance requirement after a future refrigerant conversion. Multiple companies and industry participants had also read the specifications, with some concluding that only the initial 900-ton performance level was necessary.

 In favor of the Department of Veterans Affairs, some arguments center on the view that the contract and its drawings, when read together, unequivocally set a minimum cooling performance that must be maintained, even if the refrigerant is changed. This position relies on federal procurement regulations stating that anything shown in the drawings or mentioned in the specifications is binding as if it appears in both. Proponents also stress case law such as Community Heating & Plumbing Co., Inc. v. Kelso, which places the burden on contractors to inquire about potential ambiguities if the contract might demand a certain performance in more than one scenario. Supporters of the Department of Veterans Affairs contend that the language calling for a 900-ton requirement is unqualified and that ignoring this would produce an outcome where the system’s performance could drop significantly and still meet the contract’s terms, a result they regard as inconsistent with standard performance-based contracting principles.

 For Orion Construction Company, the strongest arguments rest on the position that the contract never plainly stated that the 900-ton requirement had to remain intact following the eventual switch to the lower ozone-depleting refrigerant. This reading stems from the absence of a clear mandate in the relevant specification clauses or drawings that addresses performance after such a conversion. Orion Construction Company points out that, under controlling precedent such as Newsom v. United States, if an ambiguity is latent rather than obvious, a contractor’s reasonable interpretation should stand, particularly if no bid documents or guidance explicitly required maintaining the full 900-ton capacity once a different refrigerant was used. Supporters of Orion Construction Company point as well to trade practices and the lack of any practical feasibility for maintaining 900 tons post-conversion, suggesting that the contract’s silence on this scenario reasonably justified their interpretation.


Based on the facts above and your knowledge of the law, think step by step to figure out which party should prevail: Department of Veterans Affairs or Orion Construction Company
