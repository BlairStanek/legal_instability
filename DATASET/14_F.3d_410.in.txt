You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan and several other individuals were charged with conspiring to distribute controlled substances over a span of several years. After some of his alleged co-conspirators had already been apprehended, tried, and sentenced, Morgan was later arrested and found guilty of the same conspiracy. During the earlier proceedings of the co-conspirators, there was uncertainty about whether parole was permissible due to changes in the statutory sentencing scheme. Morgan’s capture and eventual conviction occurred once the revised statute, which disallowed parole, appeared to be in effect.

 Morgan contended that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy before the effective date of the amended statute. He argued that his sentence should fall under the older version of the sentencing law, which allowed the possibility of parole. Although Morgan’s direct appeal did not initially raise this point, he pursued relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, asserting that the amended statute’s application to his case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. At resentencing, a new judge received a supplemental presentence report and examined the total conspiracy drug amounts reported for Morgan and the co-conspirators.

 In the resentencing, Morgan requested that the judge make specific findings on the exact quantity of drugs attributable to him and on his role in the offense, highlighting that such determinations could impact how soon he might be released on parole. Although Morgan admitted to some level of responsibility, he disagreed with the broader figures in the record. He asked the court either to resolve these factual disputes or to remove them from the report, fearing they could adversely affect the assessment made by parole or prison officials.

 In support of its position, the Government points to the procedures outlined in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, arguing that a court need not make specific findings on information that does not affect a defendant’s sentence. According to the Government, once the court has decided not to rely on disputed material for sentencing purposes, there is no requirement that the court engage in extensive fact-finding or remove the questioned information. The Government cites this rule as an adequate safeguard, contending it allows defendants to challenge disputed points in administrative settings. The Government also invokes various case precedents holding that so long as sentencing courts either resolve a factual dispute or refrain from relying on the contested material, broader concerns about parole or institutional classifications can be addressed under separate administrative protocols.

 Morgan, on the other hand, emphasizes his right to have both parole guidelines and conditions of confinement determined on the basis of accurate information. He cites the possibility that disputed assertions in the presentence report could harm him in ways beyond the official length of his sentence, particularly as parole and prison administrators often refer back to that report. Morgan argues that the court, in fairness, should strike or definitively resolve discrepancies so that no unfounded material will remain to influence any subsequent decisions about his designation or release. He further relies on judicial opinions recognizing that defendants have limited means during administrative review to effectively contest allegations once they have been recorded in presentence reports.
