You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Steven Sullivan and Ryan Davis faced multiple charges in Arizona for conduct allegedly tied to the procurement and transportation of explosives. According to the indictment, they facilitated the purchase of 2900 detonators in Arizona on behalf of a group referred to here as the Praxis Movement. Those detonators were then sent via a Canyon bus to a location renamed here as Whitepoint, and ultimately forwarded overseas for violent uses against military personnel in another country. Authorities later claimed that unexploded detonators matching this batch were discovered repeatedly at bomb-related sites.

 Prior to the Arizona charges, both individuals had engaged in negotiations in another state to obtain a Hornet missile and certain large-caliber firearms. This negotiation proved unsuccessful because they dealt with undercover agents, resulting in a conspiracy prosecution against them in the district court in that other state. They were found guilty and initially received sentences at the higher end of the guidelines range. During that first prosecution, the Government introduced some facts suggesting that they had assisted in shipping the same 2900 detonators at issue in the Arizona case.

 Following the verdict in the first prosecution, an appellate court vacated their sentences and remanded for additional findings. In the meantime, Arizona authorities brought the separate indictment that again placed emphasis on the acquisition and shipment of the 2900 detonators. Steven Sullivan and Ryan Davis argued that they already had been subjected to legal jeopardy in connection with the same explosives-related conduct. They also claimed that the Government filed the Arizona charges in retaliation for their prior legal actions, including challenges to their convictions and the rejection of an upward sentencing departure by the district court in the earlier prosecution.

 In support of the Government, it is argued that the law allows separate prosecutions when distinct statutory violations are charged, emphasizing that one prosecution may involve conspiracy-related counts while another addresses substantive offenses relating to different aspects of the same broader scheme. The Government further relies on principles reflected in decisions such as Abney v. United States, underscoring that there must be a clear showing of completed jeopardy with final sentencing outcomes before claiming double jeopardy. In addition, the Government maintains that initiating a new prosecution stemming from earlier investigative leads or evidence does not, in and of itself, show any improper motive. Citing federal statutes like 18 U.S.C. § 33, 18 U.S.C. §§ 842(a)(3)(A), 844(a), and others, the Government contends that each count in the indictment must be addressed separately on its own legal merits.

 On behalf of Steven Sullivan and Ryan Davis, it is argued that the prohibition on double jeopardy bars the Government from prosecuting them again based on conduct previously used to secure a sentencing enhancement. They point to authorities holding that, when certain acts are treated as “relevant conduct” in one proceeding, a subsequent prosecution or conviction for those same acts may amount to an impermissible second punishment for identical conduct. They further contend that the facts supporting the Arizona charges were explicitly considered when they were initially sentenced in the earlier proceeding, signifying that those same acts have already formed part of the punitive outcome. Additional reliance is placed on caselaw from other appellate courts suggesting that a second prosecution may be foreclosed if the same conduct was undeniably part of the first sentencing calculus. Finally, they argue that the timing of the Arizona indictment, as well as their attempts to challenge conclusions in the earlier case, support their contention that the Government acted with improper motives in launching this new prosecution.
