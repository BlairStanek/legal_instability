You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Casey Green served as a teacher of Speech and Theatre at Riverside College, which was part of the University of Georgia. Early in 1987, he was assigned only one class, while an older teacher received two classes. Casey Green was about 40 years old. He viewed the assignment disparity as problematic and believed it negatively affected his pay because instructors’ salaries depended on the number of classes they taught.

 After raising an informal complaint, Casey Green was given a second class, though not the one he had originally requested. In the following years, he claimed he was removed from certain courses and passed over for higher salary increases. He attributed these outcomes to retaliation for having complained about alleged age discrimination. The Board of Regents of the University of Georgia, on the other hand, contended that any adverse actions occurred because Casey Green failed to follow departmental procedures and did not meet instructional standards.

 A college Grievance Committee found some smaller-scale issues, such as delayed access to course information for Casey Green and a sudden scheduling of a departmental meeting that he did not learn about in time. Casey Green also pointed to what he considered further examples of conduct aimed at undermining him, while the Board of Regents of the University of Georgia noted a situation in which his teaching performance was criticized so much that all of the students’ tuition in one of his classes was refunded. In the resulting lawsuit, Casey Green demanded relief for alleged age discrimination and retaliation, while the Board maintained that no unlawful motivation ever existed.

 In support of Casey Green’s position, several legal arguments were advanced under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. One argument was that a person who raises a complaint of age-related bias should not be subjected to reduced teaching opportunities or lower salary raises simply because of making that complaint. This argument cited the principle recognized under laws aimed at preventing retaliation: that even if the original discrimination question is debatable, an employer cannot penalize employees for exercising their right to complain. Additionally, it was emphasized that any significant difference in pay or teaching assignments following a formal or informal objection to potential discrimination could indicate retaliatory intent. Reliance was placed on the concept that such disparate treatment can be demonstrated by temporal proximity—the close timing between the complaint and the alleged detrimental actions. It was also argued that even seemingly minor acts, if cumulatively harmful, can constitute retaliation under relevant statutory and case law. According to this line of reasoning, the existence of any wage discrepancies, class reassignments, or procedural irregularities afterward could suffice to suggest a retaliatory motive, consistent with the protective framework of federal anti-discrimination statutes.

 In support of the Board of Regents of the University of Georgia’s position, it was argued that Casey Green had not provided sufficient evidence to show any unlawful motive. From the Board’s perspective, any loss of classes or pay adjustments resulted from legitimate considerations, such as Casey Green’s instructional skills and whether he complied with established rules for teaching. Using interpretations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Board argued that simply alleging unfair treatment without demonstrating a true retaliatory link did not meet the evidentiary threshold required to show improper discrimination or retaliation. Citing the need for substantial proof beyond speculation, the Board contended that any reassignment or salary decision followed established procedures. Furthermore, the Board noted that documented concerns over Casey Green’s teaching quality, evidenced by student complaints and a subsequent tuition refund, provided an alternate explanation for changes to his teaching assignments and pay. Under this view, the Board maintained that it acted for non-discriminatory reasons in handling personnel matters, consistent with the legitimate business justifications recognized under federal employment law.
