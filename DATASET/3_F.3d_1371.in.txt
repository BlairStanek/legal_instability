You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Several days after Gregory Smith went missing, his partially decomposed body was discovered under leaves and pine needles at Brookside Ranch near Foxtail Springs, New Mexico. An autopsy showed he had died from a .32 caliber bullet wound. Roger Daniels, a former business partner of Gregory Smith, was initially arrested and indicted along with Michael Carter, Carter’s wife Grace Carter, and Carter’s father Paul Carter, though charges against the wife and father were later dropped. Eventually, Roger Daniels agreed to testify against Michael Carter in exchange for immunity. During the trial, there was testimony about heated disputes at Brookside Ranch, with multiple residents carrying firearms. The pivotal trial evidence tying Michael Carter to Gregory Smith on the day Smith disappeared was Roger Daniels’s testimony. However, Grace Carter testified that she had seen Smith depart with Roger Daniels, returning alone, while Michael Carter had been asleep.

 A key trial dispute involved the bedroom window from which Roger Daniels claimed to have seen Michael Carter leading Gregory Smith away. Some witnesses stated that the window was covered with thick plastic, making it difficult or impossible to see details from inside. Meanwhile, Roger Daniels insisted the window was neither covered nor obscured. Later, it emerged that government investigators apparently photographed the window area soon after the body was discovered, but those pictures were not disclosed at trial. Only a single photograph turned up, while witnesses claimed multiple additional pictures once existed that have never come to light.

 After state-court appeals and motions for a new trial, Michael Carter filed for additional forms of relief, including a habeas petition in the district court. He argued that the government’s failure to produce key photographic evidence about the bedroom window violated his rights. Procedural questions arose about whether Michael Carter had fully pursued these issues in state court and whether he had defaulted some elements of his claim. Meanwhile, there was disagreement over whether the single existing photograph was sufficiently clear or indicative of plastic covering the window. The state courts deemed this photograph cumulative of prior testimony and found it to add minimal new information. Conflict remained over whether, taken as a whole, these photographic materials would have affected the jury’s perception of Roger Daniels’s credibility and the overall proof of Michael Carter’s involvement.

 Michael Carter contends that the undisclosed photographic evidence constitutes a violation of Brady v. Maryland and related precedents. According to this argument, the presence of plastic over the window in the photograph would have directly contradicted Roger Daniels’s account that he could see outside clearly. Because Roger Daniels’s testimony was central, Michael Carter emphasizes that any photographic documentation showing heavy plastic on the window would have significantly undermined Daniels’s version of events. Michael Carter relies on Supreme Court cases defining “materiality” in terms of a reasonable probability that nondisclosure could affect the outcome. Referencing United States v. Bagley, he maintains that showing the photograph at trial would have created sufficient doubt about Roger Daniels’s story to change how the jury viewed the evidence. Citing other authority on cause and prejudice, Michael Carter argues that these photographs were not merely impeaching but would alter the factual foundation of the prosecution’s case.

 James Reynolds, on the other hand, argues that the photograph is inconclusive or only marginally relevant, making it neither clearly exculpatory nor sufficiently material. Under precedents such as Agurs, he contends that a mere possibility the undisclosed photo could assist the defense does not rise to the constitutional standard needed to prove a Brady violation. According to James Reynolds, even if the image showed plastic, it would only impeach Roger Daniels’s testimony, and it would not conclusively exclude an unobscured view or otherwise prove Michael Carter’s innocence. He also emphasizes doctrines derived from default rules in Coleman v. Thompson and related cases, asserting that any claims about multiple missing photographs had not been properly pursued in state proceedings. Consequently, James Reynolds insists that the undisclosed evidence fails to satisfy the threshold of demonstrating that the verdict hinged on whether the window was covered, and that the record, taken as a whole, remains consistent with Michael Carter’s guilt even if the disputed photograph were introduced.
