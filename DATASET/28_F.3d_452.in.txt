You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On a November day in 1988, Julian Jordan (also known as Michael Todd) was taken into custody by the West Lake Town Police Department on an allegation of vehicle theft. After a brief period in a local holding cell, the West Lake Town Police Department requested that Morgan County sheriff’s deputies assist because there were outstanding warrants for Jordan’s arrest. Deputies Ethan Lane and Adam Kroll arrived, handcuffed Jordan, placed leg restraints on him, and began transporting him to the Morgan County Jail.

 When they arrived at the secure intake area behind the jail, the two deputies left the vehicle to check their weapons in accordance with procedures. At that point, the deputies realized that Jordan had slipped out of his handcuffs and leg restraints. Jordan fled toward a closing doorway leading out of the intake area. Fearing he might escape, the deputies ordered him to stop multiple times.

 As Jordan continued crawling under the descending door, the two deputies fired several shots. Jordan suffered fatal injuries from the gunfire. His family members later filed a civil action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming the sheriff and Morgan County were responsible for a policy authorizing such force against a detainee, and that there had also been inadequate training regarding the use of deadly force. Morgan County and Franklin Frye (the sheriff, sued in his official capacity) contested these claims, asserting that the deputies followed an official policy grounded in Tex. Penal Code § 9.52.

 In support of Morgan County’s and Franklin Frye’s position, it was argued that the circumstances required immediate action to prevent a likely escape by an individual already subject to arrest and detention. They pointed to the fact that Jordan was in custody at the time, citing a recognized interest in preserving orderly confinement and preventing unauthorized departures from a correctional environment. They emphasized that the policy traced its foundation to Tex. Penal Code § 9.52, which expressly permits force, including deadly force, to prevent escape from a jail or similar institution. They also argued that previous decisions such as Graham v. Connor and Valencia v. Wiggins support framing the matter as one of institutional security and legitimate government authority to safeguard detainees within a correctional system. Morgan County further maintained that there was no showing of malice or punitive motive, but rather a good-faith effort to stop a detainee’s immediate flight.

 In support of the Jordan Family’s position, it was argued that any use of force to halt an escape must be evaluated under established constitutional standards, with reference to decisions like Tennessee v. Garner. They noted that Jordan, although fleeing, was known to be unarmed and posed no direct threat to the deputies or the public. They underscored that applicable standards forbid deadly force against individuals who present no danger beyond potential flight, contending that the Morgan County policy allowing deadly force under such circumstances fails the requirement of reasonableness. They also argued that there should be specific training that warns officers not to resort to such measures unless they have strong grounds to believe the detainee poses a significant threat. The Jordan Family asserted that the absence of any indication that Jordan intended violence renders the policy in direct conflict with constitutional safeguards recognized in Fourth Amendment case law, particularly as clarified by decisions like Tennessee v. Garner.
