You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Eleven named individuals sued Lakeway Lodging Inc. under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), alleging that they were terminated and not rehired because of their age. Carter, who had worked for Lakeway Lodging Inc. in Midvale, sought to join the lawsuit as an additional plaintiff. All those involved had been employed by Lakeway Lodging Inc. for varying lengths of time before their employment ended as part of a corporate reorganization. Carter was informed that he was being terminated on the same day as many of the originally named individuals.

 After the termination notices were given, Lakeway Lodging Inc. requested that Carter remain on the job for several months and sign a waiver of claims. He stayed until the fall of that year, training a significantly younger replacement employee, Kelly Moore, whom the company had hired shortly before Carter’s departure. Meanwhile, one of the other named individuals, Sam Graham, also received a termination notice and later filed a charge with the EEOC in Ellistown, claiming that he and others missed out on available positions because of age bias.

 Carter subsequently filed an EEOC charge, but it was undisputedly outside the time window that typically applies under the ADEA for Tennessee-based claims. Carter argued that his claim should still go forward by relying on the charges filed by the other named individuals. Lakeway Lodging Inc. opposed Carter’s effort, raising questions about whether he could join this lawsuit without having filed a timely EEOC charge, and also challenging whether the original complaints lodged with the EEOC contained sufficient notice that multiple people were affected.

 In support of Carter’s position, there were references to the single filing rule, by which an individual can become part of a lawsuit if another similarly situated individual filed a timely and valid administrative charge under the ADEA. That rule is frequently justified on grounds that it prevents needless duplication of charges and supports judicial economy. Carter’s side relied on statutes like 29 U.S.C. § 626(d) for the mandatory charge-filing requirement but argued that the existence of at least one timely charge concerning the same alleged discrimination adequately put both Lakeway Lodging Inc. and the EEOC on notice of potential widespread claims. Proponents of Carter’s view contended that any attempt by him to file another charge within or beyond the deadline would have brought no additional benefit, and they pointed to decisions in which courts had invoked the principle that once an employer and the EEOC are notified of a practice, further individual filings serve little additional purpose.

 Lakeway Lodging Inc. countered with arguments that the purpose of the ADEA’s filing requirement is to allow the EEOC to investigate and attempt conciliation before litigation proceeds, and that Carter’s missed deadline undermined the process. Lakeway Lodging Inc. also maintained that for Carter to rely on another person’s EEOC charge under the single filing rule, the earlier charge must explicitly claim that multiple individuals were being discriminated against. According to Lakeway Lodging Inc., only if the charge advised the company and the agency of the possibility of broader liability would Carter or others be able to join. Furthermore, Lakeway Lodging Inc. noted that Carter filed a charge eventually, and that by the time the matter was disputed, the process for resolving Carter’s claim through administrative means had already been disrupted, contradicting what the statutes and regulations intended in requiring timely filings.
