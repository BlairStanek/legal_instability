You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In late 1977, Jessie Hall, a student at the State University College of Arts and Sciences at Redfield, went missing. A wide-ranging police investigation focused on various individuals, including Paxton Green. At one point, Green spoke with police about taking a polygraph test, but his attorney, Patrick Prince, advised against it and told the police to stop questioning Green unless he was arrested. The police then directed Alex Brooks, who was facing robbery charges, to gather information from Green. Brooks ultimately told the police that Green had confessed to killing Hall and asked Brooks to help move her body. Green was arrested at a rural site after being observed there with Hall’s frozen remains. At the time of his arrest, authorities reported that he made statements expressing remorse.

 Green was tried for second-degree murder in Stevens County. Before trial, he sought to suppress certain statements and physical evidence, including items found in his car and statements made to Brooks. The court allowed most of the evidence, and Green testified that Brooks had actually been responsible for killing Hall. Green was convicted of one form of second-degree murder. On appeal, the highest state court reversed and required a new trial, ruling that the police’s use of Brooks violated Green’s right to counsel and that certain statements and physical evidence should not be introduced at the second trial.

 Renovations to the usual courthouse led Green’s second trial to be held in a local house of worship in Foxwood. Both the defense and the prosecution objected to this location. Due to publicity about the case, many prospective jurors were excused, prompting Green to argue that he could not receive a fair trial. Expert testimony at the retrial presented conflicting views concerning the timing of Hall’s death, and a new witness, Jordan Daly, testified that Green had admitted beating Hall before checking for her pulse. Although Green faced the same second-degree murder charge, he was ultimately convicted of a lesser offense. Later, based on his prior convictions, the court sentenced him under a persistent felony offender statute, giving him a lengthy term of incarceration.

 Blair Jackson contends that extensive police investigative efforts, including the use of an informant, were proper because they arose only after Green had indicated potential involvement and would not cooperate with standard investigatory tests. Jackson emphasizes that any resulting statements at the crime scene were spontaneously volunteered and not induced by an unconstitutional interrogation. In addition, Jackson points to state law governing successive or related prosecutions, arguing that retrying Green on a lesser offense with a distinct mental-state requirement does not violate double jeopardy rules established by cases such as Blockburger v. United States. Jackson also claims no unfair prejudice arose from holding the trial in a local house of worship, asserting that the place of trial did not impede public access, nor did it inject religion into the proceedings in a manner that compromised impartial adjudication. Finally, Jackson maintains that persistent offender sentencing is firmly based on well-established statutes, underscoring that an enhanced sentence is justified by Green’s prior record and the goals of protecting public safety through longer incarceration.

 Paxton Green contends that his right to a fair trial was undermined by the highly publicized nature of the case, which he argues tainted the jury pool to such an extent that no impartial panel could be seated. He also asserts that convening the trial in a local house of worship, which he believes was adorned with religious symbols, imposed a psychological and potentially coercive influence on jurors, thereby breaching long-standing constitutional principles separating religious settings from judicial proceedings. Green further challenges any second prosecution for events arising from Hall’s death, relying on the argument that the factual overlap triggers double jeopardy protections under precedents that limit reprosecution when a defendant has already faced trial for conduct involving the same incident. Lastly, Green argues that use of informant-driven statements and evidence from his arrest scene was implicitly tainted by earlier investigatory failures to respect his counsel’s directives, and thus, in his view, all resulting physical items or admissions should have been suppressed as an improper extension of that original constitutional violation.
