You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Mason Jackson served as a long-haul truck driver for Green Logistics Corp. out of its facility in Briartown, North Carolina. During one series of deliveries, he was dispatched to Faircreek, Florida, and later to Everton, Tennessee. He drove under running times negotiated between Green Logistics Corp. and Local Collective No. 33 of the National Drivers Alliance. Jackson took various breaks and arrived later than the company anticipated. As a result, he received several written notices from Green Logistics Corp. referencing delayed freight.

 On one occasion, Jackson departed Briartown for Faircreek after being awake for many hours. Equipment repairs also slowed his departure, causing him to leave later than planned. Partway through his drive, he felt fatigued and pulled over to sleep. This contributed to a late arrival, which in turn led to a disciplinary notice accusing him of delaying freight and equipment. A few days later, Jackson took runs between Briartown and Everton. On both legs of the trip, he again arrived after the company’s expected schedule, in part due to an extra coffee break on one run and heavy traffic, rain, fog, and a vehicular accident on the other. After returning to Briartown, Jackson spent additional time unloading his personal belongings. The company then issued further disciplinary notices, including a multi-day suspension.

 Jackson challenged these disciplinary measures by filing complaints with the Department of Labor under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. The main dispute focused on whether Jackson was protected against discipline for stopping to rest and for voicing concerns about the contents of his employment file. Green Logistics Corp. contended that it had established procedures — such as a “slide” option for extra rest, grace periods, and the ability for drivers to choose days off — all designed to prevent fatigue-related issues. The company also pointed out that Jackson had been repeatedly counseled for delayed freight in the months leading up to the disciplinary letters. Some evidence was introduced showing that Jackson believed he was free to operate at his own pace without facing consequences, whereas the company placed emphasis on timely deliveries.

 In support of Mason Jackson’s position, advocates point to provisions of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act that protect drivers who refuse to operate a commercial motor vehicle under unsafe conditions, including those caused by fatigue. They reference 49 U.S.C. app. §§ 2301-2305, highlighting that Congress passed these rules to reduce unsafe highway conditions and to ensure that drivers are not punished for refusing to violate safety standards. They also stress 49 C.F.R. § 392.3, which bars operation of a vehicle while the driver’s alertness is impaired. According to these arguments, Jackson’s decision to stop when he noticed his fatigue and weaving on the road was precisely the kind of behavior these statutes were intended to shield. They maintain that Jackson’s repeated oral objections to having disciplinary letters in his file constitute protected activity under federal law, contending that workplace safety standards require an employee to be free from retaliation when raising issues regarding potential regulatory noncompliance.

 In support of Green Logistics Corp.’s position, advocates argue that discipline was imposed not for stopping to rest while fatigued but rather because of a consistent pattern of delayed freight. They emphasize the multiple warnings and counseling sessions Jackson received about tardiness and note that Jackson knowingly accepted dispatches even when he anticipated being overtired. They assert that the company’s internal policies — which allowed drivers to take extended rest breaks, to slide their assignments, and to choose additional off-days — surpass legal requirements for preventing fatigue. Proponents of this view contend that Jackson chose not to use these avenues for adequate rest, leading to unnecessary delays. They maintain that the driver’s actions compromised the company’s legitimate business needs and contractual commitments, rather than serving solely as an exercise of protected rights under federal safety statutes.
