You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, an apartment belonging to Taylor Smith was entered and a television was taken. Around the same time, Morgan Parker saw Cameron Reed near Smith’s residence in Grayville, Colorado, observed him moving away quickly, and later saw him inside Smith’s apartment. After contacting local authorities, Parker provided the license plate of a SunCrest automobile driven by Reed, leading to Reed’s apprehension. Smith stated that Reed had no permission to be on the property and later noticed the television missing. Law enforcement personnel found pry marks on the apartment door. Reed, for his part, emphasized that his whereabouts during the relevant period included driving around nearby areas such as Lakewell and making a stop at a TruFoods restaurant. No dispute arose over property ownership or general timing of events.

 Cameron Reed was tried for second degree burglary and theft in Colorado. During the trial, witness Morgan Parker identified Reed and recounted seeing him depart the apartment shortly before police arrived. Officers testified about signs of forced entry. Reed testified in his own defense to challenge Parker’s identification, claiming he had been traveling to different locations in the area and was elsewhere when the break-in occurred. Another witness corroborated part of Reed’s timeline by observing him in Lakewell.

 At trial, the presiding judge gave several instructions outlining the elements of second degree burglary. One instruction listed various elements, but it did not explicitly use the term “unlawfully” in front of “enters,” even though a separate instruction defined “unlawfully enters.” Reed’s counsel indicated to the jury that the prosecution’s evidence established each element other than the question of whether Reed was the individual who committed the crime. Counsel maintained that identity was the only disputed matter.

 In support of Alex Green’s position, several arguments appear in the record relying on the idea that the instructions, when read as a whole, provided adequate notice of all necessary elements. References are made to Cupp v. Naughten and other authority for the position that a single part of the instructions should not be viewed in isolation. Proponents of this view stress that the phrase “unlawfully enters” was defined elsewhere, the defense explicitly conceded all elements except identity, and there was no claim at trial that the entry might have been authorized. They also invoke Henderson v. Kibbe and Estelle v. McGuire for the principle that due process challenges must evaluate instructions in the broader context of the overall proceedings, including the uncontested nature of the forced entry.

 In support of Cameron Reed’s position, arguments turn on the assertion that second degree burglary requires a finding of “unlawful” entry as an essential element, and the omission of that term in the list of elements nullified a core statutory requirement. These arguments cite Rael v. Sullivan and Hunt v. State of Oklahoma for the contention that omitting an essential element from the instructions can compromise a fundamental right to due process. They also rely on Henderson v. Kibbe in arguing that the record must clearly show the jury made all the required findings to convict. Reed’s position emphasizes that no matter the strength of evidence on forced entry, instructions must explicitly mandate the jury to find each statutory element, and a definition in a separate instruction cannot substitute for listing the essential element itself.
