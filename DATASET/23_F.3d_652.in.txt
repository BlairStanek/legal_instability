You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Stephen Lee was an inmate in a facility operated by the New York State Department of Correctional Services. He received a Misbehavior Report alleging that he possessed both a metal rod classified as a prohibited weapon and extra state bedding not authorized under facility rules. An officer, later identified in the lawsuit as P. Henderson, reported finding these items during a cell inspection. Stephen Lee stated he had recently moved into the cell and that the items belonged to its former occupant.

 A Tier III disciplinary hearing was conducted, presided over by A. Martin as the hearing officer. During the hearing, Stephen Lee requested that several witnesses be called, including the officer who wrote the Misbehavior Report, another officer who supervised the relevant gallery, and a sergeant who handled inmate housing at the facility. The hearing officer denied these requests. After the hearing, Stephen Lee was found guilty of the charged violations and received a disciplinary sentence of confinement in the Special Housing Unit.

 Stephen Lee subsequently utilized the facility’s administrative appeals process. That process overturned the disciplinary determination and authorized a rehearing. Although the reversal occurred before Stephen Lee completed his disciplinary sentence, he was released from the Special Housing Unit sometime later. He then filed a lawsuit seeking damages for an alleged denial of his procedural due process rights, naming A. Martin and other officials. In his complaint, Stephen Lee contended that his inability to secure witnesses during the hearing violated due process requirements. A. Martin subsequently moved to dismiss the lawsuit on grounds that any procedural errors were cured by the administrative reversal.

 In support of Stephen Lee’s position, it was argued that a person deprived of liberty through solitary or restrictive confinement based on allegedly flawed disciplinary procedures retains a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 even if an administrative mechanism later overturns the initial ruling. Citing decisions such as Wolff v. McDonnell and Patterson v. Coughlin, these arguments emphasize that procedural safeguards—particularly the right to call witnesses—are integral to due process, and that failure to provide them at the time of the hearing cannot be remedied merely by a subsequent reversal. References were also made to Cleavinger v. Saxner for the principle that individuals adjudicating disciplinary matters generally have only qualified, rather than absolute, immunity from suits arising out of these proceedings. Stephen Lee’s position argues that a hearing officer’s noncompliance with clearly established procedural rules results in a distinct constitutional injury once the punishment commences, and that subsequent events cannot deprive the inmate of a remedy for that past violation.

 In support of A. Martin’s position, it was argued that the rapid availability and use of an internal administrative appeal within the New York Prison System can remedy procedural deficiencies in disciplinary hearings. Citing the notion that a legal or administrative avenue can redress any due process issue, the advocacy underscores that an erroneous ruling reversed through an established appeals process should not impose liability if the facility’s processes are timely. In Young v. Hoffman, for instance, it was reasoned that an inmate’s liberty interest might not be harmed where an adverse disciplinary finding is swiftly set aside. A. Martin’s position contends that recognizing a continuing claim for damages when the administrative mechanism quickly revokes a penalty could discourage reliance on these built-in review procedures and lead to excessive litigation premised on short-term confinement that has been formally nullified by internal corrections authorities.
