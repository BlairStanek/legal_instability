You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A group of public housing residents in Washington, including Southwood Residents Organization, Thomas Allen, and Lisa Carter, challenged a decision by HUD regarding certain eviction processes. These individuals occupied public housing in Washington and became concerned when local housing agencies informed them that they could proceed with evictions tied to criminal conduct without first offering informal grievance hearings. The central question arose because HUD sent an official communication to the governor of Washington, indicating that the state’s eviction procedures satisfied various due process requirements. Afterward, several public housing agencies revised their leases and procedures accordingly, eliminating some pre-eviction hearings.

 The residents felt they had been excluded from a critical regulatory process because HUD did not announce its reasoning or seek public input before making its determination. At least two tenants—Lisa Carter and Thomas Allen—received notices warning of evictions for alleged criminal activity and informing them they would not receive a pre-eviction hearing. Although those notices were later withdrawn, the residents remained concerned that the same procedure could be used in the future. Meanwhile, various housing agencies in different parts of Washington changed or began changing their own internal policies to conform to HUD’s determination.

 Concerns also arose over whether those challenging the HUD determination were truly affected by the new eviction procedures, as not everyone served with an eviction notice faced immediate or continuing risk of removal. Some argued that only those tenants actually threatened with imminent eviction connected to criminal charges would be directly impacted. Others countered that the residents faced a realistic risk because they lived under leases that no longer guaranteed them an informal grievance hearing if accused of certain activities.

 In support of the first party’s position, legal arguments focused on the idea that HUD’s determination was essentially a substantive rule that did more than merely interpret existing law. Proponents of this view pointed to 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(k) and its framework directing how eviction hearings and due process standards should be crafted, noting that the phrase “as the Secretary shall establish by rule” contemplates a requirement for broader procedural safeguards. These advocates explained that an agency’s own regulation, found in 24 C.F.R. § 10.1, called for notice-and-comment rulemaking whenever substantive rights would be modified. They underscored that the change in grievance procedures stripped tenants of a previously available step, suggesting that the rule’s breadth warranted public participation. In their view, the Administrative Procedure Act’s general principles also supported the need for formal input since the outcome had the future effect of allowing eviction without additional hearings when criminal activity was alleged.

 In support of the other party’s position, legal arguments emphasized that HUD’s communication simply applied an existing set of federal regulations to a specific state’s statutory eviction framework rather than making any new, broadly applicable rule. Advocates maintained that HUD was merely determining whether Washington’s procedures, already established by state law, matched the agency’s existing requirements. They argued that this function was more akin to an adjudicative or interpretive process, not one that altered any existing rule or created new obligations. Under this reasoning, HUD’s approach neither triggered the full panoply of notice-and-comment procedures nor expanded the scope of federal law beyond what was already prescribed by 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(k). They contended that only individuals directly subject to eviction for criminal activity—those with actual, immediate proceedings—could demonstrate sufficient injury to challenge the process, suggesting that more generalized concerns might not rise to a level warranting extensive procedural protections.
