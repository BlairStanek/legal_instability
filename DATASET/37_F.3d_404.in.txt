You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


John Owens, who identifies as both Black and a born-again Christian, held a position as the director of a data-processing operation within Bright County Government. In that role, he supervised several dozen individuals and was charged with overseeing the delivery of data-related services. According to the record, Bright County Government had periodic concerns about the timeliness of projects and the overall morale within the department that Mr. Owens supervised. A consultant was eventually retained to analyze the department’s operations, recommending a restructuring that led to layoffs and terminations.

 Around the same time, some employees within the data-processing department shared Mr. Owens’s religious beliefs, while others did not. Before the restructuring, Mr. Owens had organized or participated in religious discussions and prayer gatherings before official work hours, including some in the Bright County facility. After the restructuring, rumors circulated that employees who did not share his religious views might be targeted for layoffs or unfavorable assignments. Mr. Owens held a departmental meeting to address these concerns, indicating he would not evaluate anyone’s religious practices when making staffing decisions. Later, complaints arose about the use of county time and resources in ways some considered to be religious activity.

 In response to these complaints, a manager with oversight authority investigated the circumstances and wrote a report. Subsequently, Mr. Owens received a written directive from a county leader instructing him to stop using government resources for religious purposes and to ensure the workplace did not include religious proselytizing or counseling. He was further asked to remove from his office any objects perceived to have religious significance. At one juncture, Mr. Owens specifically asked about his Bible, and he was told to remove it as well. Another employee also removed personal items of a religious nature. Additionally, concerns were raised about workplace efficiency, departmental leadership, and other workplace conduct unrelated to religion.

 Bright County Government relies on several legal contentions in support of its position. First, it cites Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to explain that when religious expression risks disturbing neutrality or workplace efficiency, certain restrictions may be permissible. It underscores legal principles from Connick v. Myers, which hold that a public employer has a heightened interest in the orderly operation of its offices, and from Pickering v. Board of Educ., which sets out a balancing test that allows public employers to consider efficiency and workplace harmony in limiting certain expressions. Bright County Government also points to the need for departments to avoid potential Establishment Clause issues and to respect the differing religious preferences of other employees. It references Thomas v. Review Bd. for the principle that even fundamental rights may sometimes yield if restrictions are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest, in this instance preserving both employee morale and the government’s stance of neutrality. Bright County Government further asserts that the measures taken were aimed solely at preventing actual or perceived endorsement of any one faith within its offices.

 In response, John Owens offers multiple arguments asserting that his constitutional and statutory protections should prevail. He highlights that Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race or religion and contends that his discharge was motivated by improper considerations tied to both his race and his faith. By invoking Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, he maintains that even partial reliance on religious or racial bias would violate federal law. He further argues that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause is infringed if a public employer compels him to forgo religious practices or personal expressions of faith in the workplace, pointing to Thomas v. Review Bd. for the proposition that government-imposed burdens on sincere religious expression must survive strict scrutiny. Mr. Owens asserts that lower-impact alternatives, such as allowing personal religious items or prayer in a private capacity, would not disrupt any legitimate government interest. He contends that forcing him to remove items central to his faith, including his Bible, goes beyond reasonable accommodation and imposes a substantial burden on his free exercise rights.
