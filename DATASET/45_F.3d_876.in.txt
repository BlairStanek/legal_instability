You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan Gray and Ryan Cole became involved in litigation after Ryan Cole faced a criminal charge in a court within Texas. The charge centered on an accusation of a serious offense, and the proceedings took place with a jury. After the parties presented their cases over multiple days, the jury began deliberating on the fourth day of trial.

 Roughly five hours into deliberations, the jurors informed the trial judge that they could not agree on a verdict. In response, the judge provided them with a supplemental instruction commonly known as an Allen charge. The text of this charge asked jurors to listen to each other and to try to reach a consensus. Within about an hour and twenty minutes after hearing the instruction, the jurors returned a unanimous guilty verdict against Ryan Cole. Ryan Cole’s counsel had objected to certain language in the instruction, arguing that it improperly pressured minority jurors to conform to a majority view.

 Ryan Cole’s subsequent appeal in Texas courts raised concerns about the propriety of the Allen charge, asserting that it might have coerced the jury. Morgan Gray contended that any challenge to the supplemental instruction was barred by procedural rules because trial objections were not properly preserved according to state law requirements. Despite that dispute, Ryan Cole sought further relief on federal constitutional grounds, claiming that the supplemental instruction violated principles of fairness during criminal proceedings.

 In support of Morgan Gray, proponents of the contested Allen charge relied upon the idea that a jury should be encouraged to reach unanimous verdicts. They referenced doctrines indicating that supplemental instructions, even if firm, can be valid so long as they remind each juror to listen to others and to maintain his or her own conscientious view. They also underscored authority concluding that certain language suggesting a verdict is desirable does not equate to an unconstitutional demand for conformity. By pointing to federal cases such as Lowenfield v. Phelps and Bryan v. Wainwright, Morgan Gray’s side asserted that a trial judge’s repeated instruction to continue deliberating, and even an emphasis on the need for a unanimous verdict, may not necessarily cross a constitutional boundary.

 In favor of Ryan Cole, supporters of his position argued that the specific words used in the Allen charge imposed undue influence on jurors who might have been in the minority. They cited prior cases on direct appeal—like Jenkins v. United States and United States v. Duke—where similar language was deemed coercive, pressing jurors to abandon their independent judgment rather than freely weighing the evidence. They also emphasized that the timing and context of the instruction—coming immediately after the jury first reported a deadlock—could have caused less confident jurors to believe they were obligated to move toward conviction. Drawing on constitutional principles of due process, Ryan Cole’s side insisted that the trial court’s directive undermined the jury’s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict.
