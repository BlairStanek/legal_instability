You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this dispute, Arlo County Benevolent Memorial Center is a hospital seeking a particular Medicare reimbursement classification sometimes referred to as “sole community hospital” (SCH) status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services oversees the federal regulations that define which hospitals qualify for this classification. Benevolent Memorial Center’s application cited its distance from the next closest hospital as well as its perception that it is the only meaningful source of necessary hospital services for its community. The Secretary administers and enforces regulations that set out objective criteria to determine whether a facility qualifies for special reimbursement treatment.

 The relevant background traces to legislative changes in federal laws concerning Medicare reimbursement. In 1972, Congress began authorizing cost limits, and the Secretary could exempt isolated providers from these limits. Subsequent legislation introduced the Prospective Payment System (PPS), which pays providers at prospectively determined rates rather than reimbursing their actual costs. Under PPS, the Secretary is authorized to grant exemptions or special statuses, such as SCH classification, if appropriate. Over several years, additional statutes and amendments refined both the reimbursement system and the definitions of hospitals eligible for SCH treatment. As part of these refinements, a regulation set bright-line distance criteria, weather conditions, and topography factors to determine SCH eligibility.

 Benevolent Memorial Center’s core factual contention is that it is physically near enough to another hospital—here called Solway Hospital—but that this neighboring hospital is not truly accessible in a meaningful sense to area residents. Benevolent Memorial Center believes that community members predominantly use its services due to physician referral patterns, admitting practices, or other local factors. The facility points to evidence that it is effectively the only hospital readily available for Medicare beneficiaries in the local region. The Secretary, in turn, relies on regulations that prescribe strict mileage thresholds and weather or topography-based access limitations. These regulations were promulgated against a background of advisory reports, feedback from various administrative groups, and concerns that criteria should be as uniform and predictable as possible.

 In support of the Secretary’s position, several legal arguments have been raised under key provisions of Medicare statute sections, such as 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww. These arguments emphasize that Congress broadly delegated authority to the Secretary to craft reasonable exemptions and clarifications. Proponents of this position cite the language empowering the Secretary to take into account specific factors like isolated location, weather conditions, and the absence of other hospitals. They also refer to the Secretary’s statutory discretion to determine additional criteria for evaluating SCH status. They assert that bright-line rules on distance are a rational means of promoting nationwide consistency and that the chosen mileage cutoff is supported by the statutory phrase “factors such as,” which, in this interpretation, does not compel consideration of every conceivable market factor. By pointing to continuous congressional review and multiple amendments that have not invalidated these rules, they argue that the Secretary’s approach falls well within the scope and intent of applicable federal laws. Those defending the Secretary’s stance also contend that purely distance-based brackets reduce administrative complexity and ensure an objective test for all hospitals.

 In favor of Arlo County Benevolent Memorial Center, arguments rely on the statute’s use of general phrases like “factors such as,” which the Center interprets as implicitly requiring the Secretary to look beyond physical distance. They highlight that Congress, in establishing SCH exceptions, intended a flexible evaluation of how accessible hospital services truly are for local beneficiaries. According to this view, the Secretary’s distance thresholds neglect other relevant considerations, including physician practices, community hospital usage patterns, and the local population’s actual hospital choices. The Center contends that ignoring these realities leads to an overly rigid classification scheme. Advocates for the Center further point to legislative history describing an expectation that the Secretary would develop, and take into account, a broad range of factors tied to beneficiary access. They cite examples in past regulatory frameworks where more localized, market-based criteria were considered. Thus, in their view, the regulation focusing predominantly on mileage runs contrary to the broader statutory text and underlying legislative intent that emphasizes real-world availability of hospital services.
