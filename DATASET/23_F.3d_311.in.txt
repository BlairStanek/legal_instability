You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In three related Chapter 11 proceedings, several affiliated businesses under the control of Mr. James R. Edgerton each sought to employ the same law firm, Graham & Fletcher, as their counsel. One entity, Southpeak Office Solutions Inc., was a sales and service company. Another, Blue Lane, was a nonprofit private social club that generated revenue, in part, through a management contract with Merchant Innovations Inc., which was also controlled by Mr. Edgerton. Merchant Innovations Inc. received a commission from Blue Lane plus assistance with monthly lease payments. In their bankruptcy applications, each entity was listed as either a debtor or a creditor of the others, with certain intercompany debts described as substantial and unsecured.

 Early in the proceedings, concerns arose over whether Mr. Edgerton might possess claims against the businesses he managed or owned. An initial law firm acknowledged there were “contingent” claims between Mr. Edgerton and the corporations. After that firm declined to represent all three corporate debtors in possession, Graham & Fletcher presented applications to appear on behalf of the three entities. Accompanying affidavits stated that some intercompany claims existed but provided limited details concerning validity, amounts, or whether any of the corporate debts might be targeted by avoidance actions. The named creditors in each case were not broadly served with notice of these applications, and Graham & Fletcher asked that the matter be resolved on the paperwork alone.

 The bankruptcy filings underscored that Blue Lane fully satisfied its management obligations to Merchant Innovations Inc. while owing other liabilities. Under bankruptcy rules, each debtor in possession has a statutory duty to identify preferential or fraudulent transfers and to assess the nature of contracts that a debtor may wish to assume or reject. Because Merchant Innovations Inc. had both ongoing and prepetition dealings with Blue Lane, the question arose whether a single firm could neutrally advise each separate estate. Each debtor in possession was expected to act as a fiduciary, examining potential insider payments, executory contracts, and outstanding claims involving the sister businesses.

 One position is that 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(c) expressly allows representation of a trustee (or debtor in possession) and a creditor by the same firm, so long as any conflict is purely based on the attorney’s representation of a creditor. Proponents of this side argue that intercompany debts or insider claims may be so minimal or speculative that they do not create an “actual conflict.” Indeed, they contend that no party in interest objected under the statutory procedure, that notice requirements were met, and that 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(a) should be read in light of § 327(c)’s allowance for such dual representation. Further, they assert that the trust an attorney owes to each estate can be maintained through transparent disclosures, combined with the professional responsibility to avoid advocating positions that would undermine one debtor’s interests in favor of another.

 The other position is that 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(a) places a strong emphasis on appointing only “disinterested persons” who hold no interest adverse to the estate. Supporters of this view point out that a trustee or debtor in possession must engage in searching scrutiny of prepetition payments to insiders and intercompany relationships that could be challenged under 11 U.S.C.A. §§ 547, 548, and 553. If a single firm represents multiple estates that owe, or are owed, significant sums among themselves, those arrangements can jeopardize the firm’s ability to advise each debtor effectively. This side emphasizes that even if 11 U.S.C.A. § 327(c) allows some overlap in representations, it does not override the requirement that the professional exercise independent judgment in rooting out preferential or fraudulent conduct. They maintain that separate counsel ensures each debtor receives conflict-free guidance on whether to bring avoidance actions and whether to reject or assume executory contracts with related entities.
