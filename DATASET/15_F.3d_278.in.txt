You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan Taylor was charged with fraudulent use of a credit card under 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(2). She pleaded guilty in the district court and was sentenced to serve six months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. The supervised release included conditions prohibiting additional criminal activity, banning the possession of firearms or destructive devices, and requiring participation in a substance abuse program with periodic testing as directed by the probation office. Morgan Taylor completed her initial prison term and began her supervised release.

 While serving her supervised release, Morgan Taylor was alleged to have violated the special conditions set by the district court. The probation office submitted a revocation petition, and the district court held a hearing to determine the violations. The court found that she had committed the charged violations. According to the sentencing materials, the policy statements at that time in the relevant guidelines suggested a range of six to twelve months of imprisonment, but the district court noted that the statutory maximum allowed was a longer prison term.

 The district court imposed a sentence of seventeen months based on reasoning that Morgan Taylor had shown minimal effort to cooperate with supervision and had demonstrated unresponsiveness to the conditions required of her probation. Further, the district court found that she had encountered conflicts with officers and others throughout the supervisory process. The court remarked that her issues related to substance abuse and psychological matters required a high level of structured treatment. The case turned on whether a supervising judge could rely on such treatment needs when deciding the length of imprisonment following a revocation of supervised release, and each party presented its position on the question.

 One legal position was that, under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e), the court may consider various aspects of the defendant’s circumstances, including factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), when deciding how much of the original supervised release term should be served in prison upon revocation. Its proponents argued that because courts can consider medical or rehabilitative needs when setting a period of supervised release, the same considerations should logically come into play when determining how much of a revoked supervised release term becomes incarceration. They pointed to statutory language indicating that the court “shall consider” specified factors, including the need “to provide the defendant with needed ... medical care,” and contended that nothing in those statutes categorically forbids using imprisonment in part to address a substance abuse problem once a term of supervised release is revoked. They relied on broad readings of 18 U.S.C. § 3583 and on the explicit reference to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D) in revocation proceedings, emphasizing that Congress distinctly authorized courts to revisit the offender’s needs when altering or revoking supervised release. In their view, this authority remains consistent with section 3553(a) and the policy statements referencing rehabilitative objectives, so long as the court has first found a violation of supervised release conditions.

 The opposing legal position was that the court should not imprison someone for rehabilitative or medical-care reasons, pointing to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(a), which states that imprisonment is not to be employed “as a means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.” Advocates of this position argued that the overarching legislative framework still applies at the moment of revocation, so that the court is barred from adding prison time for the sake of addressing substance abuse or psychological issues. In their view, even though 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e) directs courts to consider factors that might include needed treatment, such treatment needs cannot justify converting a term of supervised release into incarceration. Their reading of 28 U.S.C. § 994(k) underscored that the guidelines are meant to reflect the inappropriateness of ordering prison time primarily for medical or rehabilitative purposes. They stressed that the careful structure of the sentencing statutes prevents courts from relying on rehabilitation as a basis for an additional period in prison, maintaining that the legislative history and explicit statutory commands reinforce that approach.
