You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alex Jordan joined Mirfield Correctional Center in a role overseeing investigations into potential misconduct by fellow correctional officers. He contends that, after receiving praise and awards for his diligence, he discovered evidence suggesting that some guards performed questionable favors for incarcerated individuals. In his view, higher-level supervisors took offense to his discoveries and reassigned him, eventually placing him in an undesirable post outside in harsh winter conditions, where he felt unwelcome and ultimately quit. From Jordan’s perspective, he believed his reports to the local prosecutor about potential illegal activities led to retaliation.

 Warden Smith, who oversaw operations at Mirfield Correctional Center, maintains that Alex Jordan was unfit for desk duties because of his behavior. Smith points to episodes of what he describes as overzealousness—such as vigorously investigating a prank memo and intruding on other officers’ responsibilities. He portrays Jordan as a problematic subordinate who was not following directives and whose agitation caused disruption. Smith asserts that the reassignments were purely administrative and based on Jordan’s apparent inability to handle investigative work and personality conflicts with others.

 Both sides introduced multiple forms of evidence. Jordan highlighted positive performance evaluations and statements he claims indicated his efforts to expose wrongdoing. He also argued that his abrupt removal, lack of institutional support, and subsequent postings in uncomfortable conditions were retaliatory. For his part, Warden Smith provided testimony about Jordan’s consistency in overstepping boundaries, insisted that Jordan had been instructed to avoid certain areas of investigation for good reason, and emphasized that Jordan’s return to standard guard duties was the consequence of his unsuitability for administrative responsibilities.

 Warden Smith’s position rests on the argument that an employer must have freedom to reassign personnel when their performance or conduct is unsatisfactory. According to Smith’s view, a workplace akin to a paramilitary environment cannot function properly if an employee persists in disregarding strict chains of command. Citing Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks, and related precedent, Smith refers to the principle that even if protected activity appears relevant, a valid basis justifying the same employment action severs liability. Smith insists that any alleged retaliation was not the real cause of Jordan’s assignments and that the need for orderly discipline and cohesion guided his decisions. He further invokes the notion that an employer’s legitimate reasons for its actions—such as avoiding untenable disruptions—can outweigh claims of retaliatory motive.

 Alex Jordan’s arguments center on his belief that his reports of potential corruption, as well as related investigative activity, constitute protected actions deserving of heightened legal safeguards. He looks to Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle and Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins to assert that if his disclosures played a substantial role in the adverse treatment, he is entitled to relief unless the employer can prove that his reassignment and eventual constructive discharge would have happened for other legitimate reasons. Jordan also offers the view that civil protections forbid punishing employees for reporting suspected crimes, referencing Illinois statutes that discourage retaliation for informing law enforcement. He contends that the sudden shift in his supervisors’ attitudes toward him, coupled with alleged instructions to keep him out of the facility and assign him to difficult posts, indicates that the real motive was reducing exposure of corruption rather than performance-based concerns.
