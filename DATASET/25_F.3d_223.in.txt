You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Harvestgrain Co. and ENABAS, an agency of the Nicaraguan government, entered into a commercial contract for the shipment of rice to ENABAS in Nicaragua. A dispute later arose concerning the condition of the rice upon arrival. Their contract included an arbitration clause indicating that conflicts would be resolved by arbitrators chosen by mutual agreement, with the option to arbitrate in Nicaragua or under the auspices of the Cereal Producers Group in the United States.

 ENABAS subsequently proceeded under the rules of the Cereal Producers Group, whose standing arbitration committee normally appoints individuals to serve as arbitrators. Harvestgrain Co. resisted that approach, indicating that its contract with ENABAS required a different mechanism for selecting arbitrators. Harvestgrain Co. also filed an action in the district court, seeking an order compelling an arbitration in which the panel would be chosen by mutual agreement of the parties, rather than by the committee of the Cereal Producers Group.

 The district court dismissed Harvestgrain Co.’s request for the compelled arbitration procedure it sought. As the dispute continued, the committee-appointed arbitrators convened and issued an award in favor of ENABAS. The district court confirmed that award, but Harvestgrain Co. maintained that the language in the contract required an entirely different system for selecting arbitrators. ENABAS countered that designating the Cereal Producers Group in the contract necessarily incorporated that forum’s typical rules.

 Harvestgrain Co. contends that arbitration, as a matter of contract, is governed by the parties’ explicit agreement, invoking AT & T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America and emphasizing 9 U.S.C. § 5. It argues that the contractual phrase requiring arbitrators “chosen by mutual agreement” should be enforced according to its plain meaning. Harvestgrain Co. views the Cereal Producers Group’s committee-based selection as circumscribing its right to jointly pick the panel. It further cites authority disfavoring an arbitrator’s ability to decide his or her own jurisdiction, insisting that only an explicitly accepted set of arbitrators can properly hear the dispute. By focusing on the importance of contractual language, Harvestgrain Co. insists that no implied reference to the arbitration rules of the Cereal Producers Group can override the original details laid out in the contract.

 ENABAS argues that the contract’s mention of the Cereal Producers Group reflects a joint intention to embrace that institution’s standard procedures. Drawing from precedent that a reference to a well-known arbitral body normally incorporates the organization’s own selection rules, ENABAS construes “chosen by mutual agreement” to mean that both parties had already consented to the Cereal Producers Group. ENABAS emphasizes the practical realities of international commercial contracts, suggesting that the parties’ specifying a recognized arbitral institution was meant to ensure an orderly mechanism for resolving conflicts. From ENABAS’s perspective, preserving the Cereal Producers Group’s existing selection processes is the best way to give effect to that mutual choice and to fulfill the Federal Arbitration Act’s goal of facilitating dispute resolution according to agreed-upon arbitral frameworks.
