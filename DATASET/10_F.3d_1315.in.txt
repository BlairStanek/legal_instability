You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Taylor Morgan is a five-year-old who suffers from short-bowel syndrome, a condition that requires long-term intravenous nutrition and causes severe complications with her liver. She must rely entirely on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and her medical providers have indicated that she will likely require a liver-bowel transplant to survive. Casey Bell oversees a state health program responsible for administering benefits to eligible recipients, including children of Taylor Morgan’s age.

 Taylor Morgan submitted a request for the state health program to cover the costs of a liver-bowel transplant. Casey Bell’s agency, however, characterized that procedure as experimental and denied the request. The determination rested on the agency’s view that the transplant at issue had insufficient acceptance in the wider medical community. Taylor Morgan contended that the procedure was necessary because of her life-threatening condition, while Casey Bell’s agency regarded the treatment as not proven to be safe and effective.

 Discussions arose between Taylor Morgan’s physicians and the state health program regarding the efficacy of liver-bowel transplants and whether these transplants met the criteria for medically necessary procedures. Taylor Morgan believed her condition could quickly become fatal without a transplant. Casey Bell’s agency focused on regulations that allow states to exclude experimental treatments from coverage. Both parties recognized that the broader statutory framework obligates the state health program to provide certain services for qualified individuals, but disagreed about whether the liver-bowel transplant met the standards for coverage in a case involving a child’s serious medical needs.

 In favor of Taylor Morgan, one position emphasizes that federal law requires participating states to furnish “early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services” for those under 21. Because a transplant could correct or ameliorate Taylor Morgan’s life-threatening condition, supporters of this view invoke 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5) to contend that the agency must fund any medically necessary treatment uncovered by screenings. They further cite examples in which other courts or authorities have concluded that experimental or novel procedures may still be recognized as necessary when certifying physicians can provide important data on safety and effectiveness. They note that if authoritative evidence shows that the procedure is beneficial and that the broader medical community increasingly accepts it, the transplant should no longer be labeled experimental. They also rely on past cases (such as those referencing Rush v. Parham) that suggest treatments cease to be considered experimental if substantial professional acceptance or robust supporting research exists. Champions of this argument assert that the immediate risk to a child’s life makes it all the more necessary to ensure such procedures receive careful and searching inquiry before being classified as experimental.

 In favor of Casey Bell, another view holds that states administering health programs have wide discretion in determining what is medically necessary, particularly with respect to emerging procedures. This position references federal law (including 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(i)(1)) granting states the ability to adopt written standards for transplant coverage and to exclude certain procedures they deem insufficiently validated or recognized. Adherents to this position emphasize the absence of unanimous endorsement from the medical community for certain transplants, claiming that ongoing debate about long-term outcomes and safety justifies a cautious approach. They argue that language in regulations and case law (such as Rush v. Parham) confirms states do not have to cover experimental treatments. They also stress that, where there is significant ambiguity regarding success rates or lasting benefit, the agency fulfills its mandate by funding only treatments proven safe and effective. This stance maintains that deferring to professional opinions consistent with classifying a procedure as unproven helps protect both the integrity of public resources and the well-being of patients.
