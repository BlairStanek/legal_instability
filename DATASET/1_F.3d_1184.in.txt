You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Several years prior to the events at issue, Daniel Nixon purchased a circular, above-ground swimming pool from Pearson Retail & Co. The pool measured ten feet in diameter and was intended to stand twenty-four inches high. Anderson Pools, Inc. manufactured the pool for Pearson Retail & Co. Written instructions prepared and printed by Anderson Pools, Inc. were provided at the time of purchase, bearing Pearson Retail & Co.’s name. These instructions included information about supervising children in the pool but did not indicate that a fence was necessary or included. Mr. Nixon set up the pool according to the instructions in his yard, which naturally sloped so that part of the pool stood only fourteen to eighteen inches above ground level.

 Mr. Nixon maintained the pool in this condition for several years. During that period, some of the pool’s top rails were lost, and he spread the remaining rails around the pool’s rim. Replacement rails were available through Pearson Retail & Co., but Mr. Nixon did not purchase them. Meanwhile, in a neighboring home, Gray Turner resided with his family. On the day of the incident, Gray, then about sixteen months old, wandered away from his house when his mother, Marie Turner, was momentarily occupied. At some point, he found his way to Mr. Nixon’s yard and into the pool.

 Gray Turner was discovered submerged in the water and subsequently suffered severe brain injuries stemming from oxygen deprivation. Photographs taken soon after the accident showed several bent areas on the pool’s rim and missing rails. Witnesses pointed out that the instructions had told Mr. Nixon to select the lowest spot in the ten-foot circle and level the rest of the ground to that point, a procedure which left part of the pool wall significantly lower with earth built up around it. A local rule in that area required above-ground pools to be enclosed by a fence, but Mr. Nixon did not construct one around this pool.

 One side argues that the pool was designed and sold in a manner that did not amount to a defect or unreasonably dangerous condition. According to this view, the product satisfied its fundamental purpose of safely holding water for recreational use. Supporters of this position also maintain that post-sale alterations and a lack of routine maintenance created conditions that were not originally present, which they claim interrupts any causal chain of liability. Citing authority like Talley v. City Tank Corp. and other precedent describing product alterations, they emphasize a purchaser’s responsibility to maintain the item in safe working order over time, especially when replacement parts and warnings regarding adult supervision were provided.

 The other side argues that the product’s instructions and design choices made it foreseeably unsafe for small children. According to this perspective, lowering the pool on one side compromised its height and thereby allowed a toddler to climb in with relative ease. They assert that such vulnerabilities were neither fully addressed in the warnings nor apparent to the average consumer, and had Pearson Retail & Co. included a standard fence or more explicit directions urging enclosure, the risk to very young children could have been significantly reduced. Drawing on doctrines in products liability law and principles of negligence discussed in case authorities such as Collins v. Newman Machine Co., they maintain that obligations to warn or design against foreseeable dangers extend to hazards arising in ordinary use—especially hazards faced by vulnerable users who might wander into a partially lowered pool.
