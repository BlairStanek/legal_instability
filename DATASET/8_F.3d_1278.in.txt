You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Larsen served as a pilot employed by Barrett Helicopter Service. One evening, Larsen arranged to transport a critically ill individual from Oakwood to Springville at the request of Kind Care Hospital. Larsen was on call to make such flights as part of the hospital’s agreement with Barrett Helicopter Service. Shortly before departing, Larsen contacted the FAA flight service station, where Nelson, a flight service specialist, gave an incomplete weather briefing.

 The weather briefing Nelson provided relied on certain forecasts but omitted important information contained in other sources, including the Metro area forecast. This missing data related to possible rime icing, cloud ceilings below 1,000 feet, and freezing drizzle. Based on the partial briefing, Larsen took off from Oakwood and proceeded under Visual Flight Rules, flying a helicopter that Barrett Helicopter Service operated in conjunction with Kind Care Hospital. Two medical personnel also traveled on this flight.

 The helicopter ultimately went down in the open countryside of Nebraska. Investigations revealed that Larsen encountered lower ceilings, mist, or drizzle in the final stretch of the journey near various ranches, including the Young ranch, the Patel ranch, and the Reed ranch. Witnesses described cloud levels well under 1,000 feet and potential ice accumulation. The crash claimed the lives of Larsen and the accompanying medical personnel. Later litigation involved the Estate of Larsen, Barrett Helicopter Service, and Cornerstone Insurance on one side, and the United States on the other.

 Several legal arguments are offered for why the United States should not be held liable in this situation. These arguments emphasize the pilot’s independent duty under regulations such as 14 C.F.R. § 135.205(b)(2) and 14 C.F.R. § 135.207, which govern flights during nighttime and with low visibility. They assert that once airborne, it remains the pilot’s responsibility to avoid or terminate a flight in conditions that might breach either federal regulations or an operator’s more stringent internal policies. Citing precedents such as Black v. United States, proponents of this view argue that even when government flight service specialists have a regulatory obligation to provide thorough weather updates, the pilot’s choices about continuing into worsening weather—and whether to divert or land—are entirely separate matters. Since 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b) involves liability only when negligence is a proximate cause of injury, these arguments further maintain that pilot decisions during flight can supersede any prior omission by a weather briefer, especially if the pilot encounters obvious weather hazards directly and still presses on.

 Equally compelling arguments are offered for why the Estate of Larsen should prevail instead. These arguments rely on principles under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b), contending that once the FAA voluntarily undertakes to give weather information, it must do so in a complete and accurate manner. Relying on cases such as Norwest Capital Management & Trust Co. v. United States, they assert that the government’s incomplete briefing about the possibility of rime icing or very low ceilings significantly influenced Larsen’s decision to accept the flight. According to this position, the very reason government agencies have a duty to disseminate weather warnings is to prevent exactly this type of tragic outcome. Supporters of this view point to the presumption under certain case law that a deceased pilot would act with ordinary prudence if provided all relevant weather facts, meaning the flight might not have commenced had the correct data been shared. They further note that an intervening cause in Nebraska law must be unforeseeable and independent; because adverse conduct in flight may naturally arise from inadequate weather data, any subsequent pilot error should not shield the government from liability.


Based on the facts above and your knowledge of the law, think step by step to figure out which party should prevail: The United States or The Estate of Larsen
