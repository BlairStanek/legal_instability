You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Rosetta Fuel Inc. had been a branded distributor of Linden Energy Co.’s gasoline for many years in Riverwalk, Oregon. Both parties entered into a written gasoline distributorship agreement that was effective for a fixed period and contained a minimum monthly purchase requirement. Not long after the agreement took effect, Linden Energy Co. declared its intention to terminate it on grounds that Rosetta Fuel Inc. had failed to meet the minimum purchase terms.

 Rosetta Fuel Inc. claimed that Linden Energy Co. deliberately raised its gasoline prices to hinder the distributor’s ability to meet the specified purchase obligations. Seeking relief, Rosetta Fuel Inc. filed a motion in the district court, alleging violations of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. Because of this action, the district court initially granted a preliminary injunction preventing Linden Energy Co. from terminating the distributorship for a limited period.

 The contract at issue included an arbitration clause that required settlement of disputes through binding arbitration. This clause also included provisions affecting the timing for initiating claims, the availability of attorney’s fees, and the possibility of recovering exemplary damages. The district court, focusing on that arbitration clause, concluded that arbitration would be the proper forum for handling the dispute. Rosetta Fuel Inc. disagreed, asserted that key rights under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act were being curtailed, and refused to engage in the arbitral process. Litigation followed over whether that arbitration clause was enforceable given the claimed statutory protections.

 Rosetta Fuel Inc. argues that consideration of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act’s protections is crucial. Rosetta Fuel Inc. contends that franchisees are guaranteed certain statutory remedies, including the right to seek exemplary damages, recover attorney’s fees, and rely on a longer statutory period to bring suit. According to Rosetta Fuel Inc., making a prospective waiver of these rights a condition of doing business violates the Act’s purpose, which is to counteract the imbalance of power between a franchisor and a franchisee. Citing both the text and the legislative history of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, Rosetta Fuel Inc. emphasizes that Congress aimed to protect franchisees from precisely these kinds of contractual forfeitures. Therefore, Rosetta Fuel Inc. maintains that enforcement of an arbitration provision that diminishes these critical remedies undermines the Act’s core intent and should be forbidden.

 Linden Energy Co. contends that general federal policy strongly favors arbitration and that statutory claims are routinely resolved in arbitral forums without compromising substantive rights. Relying on decisions permitting arbitration of antitrust and securities cases, Linden Energy Co. notes that arbitration clauses need not be invalid simply because statutory claims are involved. Linden Energy Co. asserts that the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act contains no explicit prohibition against arbitrating disputes. In addition, Linden Energy Co. maintains that the ability to select remedies or define limitations within an arbitration agreement can be seen as part of the parties’ freedom to contract, so long as there is no explicit bar in the statute itself. Linden Energy Co. suggests that enforcing arbitration is an efficient way to resolve such disputes and that any concerns about remedies or time limitations can be balanced within arbitral proceedings consistent with the relevant provisions of federal law.
