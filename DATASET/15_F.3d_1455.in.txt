You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Law enforcement officials in North Dakota learned through two confidential informants that Jordan Parker might be involved in drug trafficking. Acting on this information, officers devised a reverse sting operation. One of the informants called Parker to entice him with a favorable offer to buy cocaine. The informants and officers later arranged a meeting at Hotel 32 in Woodridge. Before the meeting, officers retrieved confiscated cocaine from an evidence room and packaged it for the planned sale. Parker arrived, exchanged money for the drugs, and was subsequently stopped and searched in the hallway, where the officers recovered the cocaine and the money. Parker was arrested and initially charged in state court with drug offenses.

 While at the station, Parker spoke with two officers after receiving Miranda warnings and waiving his right to counsel. The officers mentioned potential penalties and assured Parker they could help him if he cooperated. Parker identified an individual named Nick Carter (an intended recipient of some of the cocaine) and other possible associates. Officers tried to arrange a controlled delivery to Carter, but Parker refused. The next day, they repeated their request, again promising to speak favorably on Parker’s behalf, but Parker again declined. Parker was convicted in the state trial, but the state supreme court reversed upon deciding that the use of the confiscated drugs for a sting was not authorized by state statute and constituted entrapment as a matter of state law.

 Following the state reversal, the United States received approval to charge Parker federally for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, distribution, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. Parker filed motions to dismiss and to suppress evidence. Parker also argued that statements he made shortly after his arrest should be deemed inadmissible on the ground that they were part of plea negotiations. Additionally, Parker raised concerns of double jeopardy, invoked res judicata and collateral estoppel, and referenced the Justice Department’s Petite policy governing successive prosecutions. He further suggested that any evidence obtained should be considered fruit of the poisonous tree if his arrest and the state operation leading up to it were unlawful from the start.

 One party contends that Parker was not induced into committing a crime that he was otherwise unwilling to commit, emphasizing that federal law on entrapment looks closely at a defendant’s predisposition. They argue that earlier information from confidential sources and Parker’s ready agreement to purchase cocaine are sufficient to show willingness. They further rely on decisions such as Hampton v. United States and United States v. Russell to demonstrate that reverse stings are acceptable investigative methods, and that only exceedingly egregious government conduct would be deemed a due process violation. They additionally invoke dual sovereignty principles from Abbate v. United States to explain why a federal prosecution may follow a state prosecution concerning the same acts. Citing relevant precedents, they contend that no statutory or constitutional prohibition bars federal authorities from using evidence gathered by state officers, that promises by investigators to “put in a good word” do not amount to plea negotiations under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, and that the Petite policy does not create enforceable rights against federal prosecutions.

 The other party asserts that Parker was unlawfully ensnared by officials who themselves engaged in impermissible or unauthorized conduct, particularly in obtaining and using previously confiscated narcotics for the sting. Referencing the state supreme court’s appraisal, they highlight statutes forbidding the use of such contraband unless expressly authorized by law, which they claim renders the transaction per se illegal. They maintain that this defect taints all evidence as fruit of the poisonous tree if the arrest followed from an illegally contrived offense. They also argue that the principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel should attach to the state’s determination that Parker could not be convicted. They contend that double jeopardy principles apply on account of the close relationship between state and federal authorities, emphasizing that the same underlying facts were used in both cases. Finally, they invoke the possibility that Parker’s statements to officers should be deemed inadmissible because they were made in the context of implied negotiations, pointing out that agents promised him leniency in exchange for cooperation.
