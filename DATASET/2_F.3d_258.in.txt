You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Conway Processing Services runs a meat-processing facility in Pine City, Nebraska, employing several hundred production and maintenance workers across two shifts. Local 452 of the Workers Organization sought to represent these employees and initiated a representational campaign. During that campaign, representatives from Local 452 aimed to generate media attention, contacting television stations in Pine City and sharing details of an upcoming rally at Conway Processing Services. These efforts were timed around an approaching election involving Conway Processing Services’ workforce.

 Alan Walker, who coordinated union activities for Local 452, reached out to various television stations, leaving messages about the union’s campaign. Walker also directed Luis Reyes, another representative, to inform Carlos Gomez about the rally. Gomez worked for Data & Service Network (DSN), a local production group creating material for a nearby cable channel. On the day before the election, Gomez arrived with Reyes outside Conway Processing Services just before one shift ended and the next began. Gomez brought video equipment, set it up near a banner displaying pro-union messaging, and recorded footage of employees entering and exiting the facility. He also briefly attempted to interview a few workers, disclosing that he was from DSN when asked. Gomez wore a hat showing support for unionization but displayed no other credentials or insignias linking him to DSN. Employees who asked the union representatives about Gomez’s affiliation were told that he was from a cable television station.

 The election took place the following day. The vote count showed that a substantial portion of employees supported representation by Local 452, but Conway Processing Services raised objections concerning the videography. The company alleged that some employees may have perceived Gomez’s filming as an intimidating tactic, particularly because it appeared to document who did or did not accept union literature. The company believed that the overall timing—on the eve of the election and during a high-traffic moment when workers changed shifts—amplified the potential for coercion. Others contended that Gomez had a legitimate media-related purpose, identified himself as working for a local production venture, and never explicitly threatened or targeted particular workers.

 In support of granting relief to the first party, arguments emphasize that the National Labor Relations Act protects fair and uncoerced choice for employees. Advocates for the first party assert that documentation or media coverage immediately prior to an election is not necessarily problematic if there is a reasonable non-threatening explanation for it. They note that labor law precedent, including cases like Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. and Mike Yurosek & Son, Inc., has turned on whether misconduct could be directly attributed to a party to the election or instead stemmed from a third party with fewer ties to the dispute. Proponents of this view point out that only clearly coercive or threatening behavior usually disrupts an election process. They highlight that under precedents such as Monark Boat Co. and NLRB v. Griffith Oldsmobile, Inc., the question often hinges on whether the conduct created an atmosphere of fear so serious that it undermined employee free choice. Invoking these doctrines, they maintain that if filming can be explained largely as a media effort without clear evidence of threats, the objections might be overcome. They further argue that, under general principles of agency law, a person’s proximity to a rally or a simple gesture of wearing similar promotional materials does not alone establish that individual’s legal agency on behalf of a union or employer, unless there was active representation or directive from that entity.

 In support of granting relief to the second party, arguments focus on the potential chilling effect that videotaping can have on employees’ willingness to exercise free choice. Looking to discussions in cases like Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. and Mike Yurosek & Son, Inc., they contend that media-style filming ahead of a high-stakes vote can easily be misconstrued as surveillance or used to identify workers who reject union materials. They assert that such conduct, even if carried out under the appearance of journalism, risks intimidating employees—especially when the camera operator is physically near other advocates, wearing pro-union apparel, and not displaying credentials. They underscore that timing is crucial: capturing footage of employees during a shift change on the eve of an election may create heightened concern that votes or allegiances are being monitored, thus undermining the principle of free choice in labor law. These arguments also invoke the logic that, if employees commonly perceive a camera operator as allied with the group promoting unionization, the employer should not have to prove an explicit threat. Instead, under the rationale found in certain decisions about third-party conduct, the potential for reprisal—real or perceived—may be enough to cast doubt on the fairness of the campaign environment.
