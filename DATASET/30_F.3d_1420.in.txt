You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Several years ago, a fifteen-year-old individual, now called Ronald Wayne Donovan, was charged in Redbridge County with the death of his younger sibling. Donovan allegedly strangled the sibling, wrapped the body, and placed it in a closet. Shortly afterward, Donovan went to a local store to buy candy and a drink, then contacted a crisis hotline to report his actions. When law enforcement officers found Donovan, he was taken into custody.

 After Donovan’s arrest, he was advised of his rights under Miranda multiple times by officers identified here as Officer Morgan and Officer Stephens of the Redbridge County Sheriff’s Office. Donovan initially agreed to speak and gave statements describing the choking. Partway through recording those statements, an attorney—here named Attorney Kelly Carter—learned of Donovan’s situation through a state agency’s notice. Attorney Carter contacted the officers and communicated that questioning should stop, but Donovan was not fully informed of every detail of that communication. The officers then continued recording Donovan’s statements, during which Donovan voiced questions about whether he should heed the attorney’s instruction. Donovan ultimately made additional comments regarding his awareness that his actions were wrong.

 Donovan underwent psychiatric evaluation before trial. Multiple experts testified about Donovan’s mental state and intelligence level, with some concluding that he understood the difference between right and wrong and others suggesting he may not have been sane at the time of the incident. During the legal proceedings, Donovan argued that the officers violated his right to silence by continuing to interview him after he suggested he might follow his attorney’s advice not to talk. In addition, Donovan argued that his youth and mental health conditions meant that any waiver of his rights was not given knowingly or intelligently. The State of Florida disputed those contentions, pointing to the exchanges between Donovan and the officers as well as expert assessments of Donovan’s mental capacity.

 In advocating for the State of Florida to prevail, several arguments were presented. One hinges on the premise that there is no absolute requirement to halt questioning if a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal reference to remaining silent or requesting counsel, drawing on legal authority such as Davis v. United States. This line of reasoning explains that law enforcement officers may continue to speak with a suspect unless the suspect unambiguously declares a wish to stop talking. Additionally, the State of Florida highlights that, under principles established in Colorado v. Connelly, a confession is deemed voluntary in the absence of police coercion. The State also contends that Donovan, by virtue of his high intellectual functioning as noted in certain expert testimony, was capable of understanding the meaning of any rights he waived. Further, from this perspective, repeated reminders of Miranda protections, coupled with no overt intimidation, reinforce the notion that Donovan’s decision to speak was voluntary.

 In advocating for Donovan to prevail, other arguments were stressed. One focuses on the claim that Donovan made a sufficiently clear invocation of his right to remain silent by indicating a desire not to “do what” the attorney advised against, and that further questioning should not have proceeded. His position draws on cases suggesting that once a suspect shows intent to stop or to speak with counsel, officers must refrain from interrogation or at least clarify the suspect’s wishes. Another contention concentrates on Donovan’s unique vulnerabilities given his youth and asserted mental health issues, leaning on doctrines such as those discussed in Fare v. Michael C. to underscore that age, background, and psychological condition can impair someone’s capacity to make a knowing and intelligent waiver. According to this view, the combination of Donovan’s age, emotional state, and possible psychiatric factors means he did not fully appreciate the significance of reopening conversation or the consequences of speaking with authorities after legal counsel intervened.
