You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Early one morning in New Mexico, a law enforcement officer from a federal border agency noticed two vehicles—a van and a sedan—exit Freeway X near a known checkpoint. They turned onto a parallel route, which the officer believed was sometimes used to bypass that checkpoint. Both vehicles had license plates from a northern region of the state, drove notably slower than the posted speed limit, and traveled close together for a time. While following the van, the officer observed a passenger looking at him through the rear window and then moving out of sight. Deciding to investigate further, the officer stopped the van. The driver was Robin Smith, a U.S. citizen, and the officer discovered multiple passengers, at least some of whom appeared to lack documentation.

 After the stop, Smith was questioned separately from the sedan, which continued driving. The officer believed there was reason to suspect that Smith’s van and the sedan might be working together in transporting unauthorized individuals. The officer emphasized that the route was lightly traveled at that time of day and was in an area where, in his experience, people sometimes attempted to circumvent formal checkpoints. Smith denied any connection to the sedan, saying the sedan’s occupants were heading elsewhere.

 Later inquiry revealed that this area within roughly sixty miles of the border often sees a mix of local traffic, including both residents and farm laborers. The Government noted that larger vehicles, such as Smith’s van, can be used to transport individuals seeking to evade detection. Smith, however, pointed out that driving slowly might be explained by mechanical problems or caution, and that encountering another vehicle on the same route does not necessarily indicate collaboration. Smith also questioned whether the officer’s observation of the sedan’s occupants’ appearance or their momentary close proximity were sufficient grounds to suspect illegal activity.

 In support of its position, The Government contended that a limited investigative stop was permissible under Terry v. Ohio and related doctrines because the totality of circumstances provided reasonable suspicion. Relying on proximity to the border, the officer’s familiarity with increased numbers of summer farmworkers, and the route’s reputation for avoiding checkpoints, The Government maintained that Smith’s vehicle fit a pattern of suspicious behavior. It pointed to the fact that the vehicles briefly traveled close together, were moving notably slowly without an obvious reason, and contained passengers whose actions—such as looking directly at the officer and then crouching—could indicate an attempt to avoid detection. Referencing standards set by cases including United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, The Government argued that the confluence of these factors justified a brief stop to assess immigration status.

 In contrast, Robin Smith argued that these observations taken as a whole did not amount to reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio. Smith noted that turning onto a secondary road or driving below the speed limit could have entirely innocent explanations. Smith contended that simply noticing a driver or passengers’ ethnicity, without further concrete indicators, is not a rational basis for concluding they are in the country illegally. Smith also challenged the implication that the two vehicles were acting jointly, pointing out that the sedan distanced itself after the officer intervened. According to Smith, the route through that region, while sometimes used by smugglers, is also a legitimate way for locals to travel. Smith emphasized that the law demands a more tangible and case-specific chain of inferences linking innocent conduct to suspicion of wrongdoing, and that no such objective, fact-based link was present here under Brignoni-Ponce and Terry.
