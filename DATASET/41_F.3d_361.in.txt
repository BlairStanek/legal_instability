You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Ross Young served as the manager of the Young Health and Fitness Center, located in Meadowville, Iowa. The building was owned by Adrian Young, who resided in Kansas. After a year of unprofitable operation, Adrian Young directed Ross Young to cease business operations, and the Young Health and Fitness Center was closed. Despite closure, various steps were taken to inventory and possibly sell the building, including a photographic record and consultation with real estate agents.

 On December 26 of that same year, Ross Young removed his personal belongings from the premises, apparently in anticipation of a potential sale. Roughly one week later, the property caught fire. Two volunteer firefighters, Marcus Bailey and Jordan Easton, tragically lost their lives while attempting to extinguish the blaze. These events led to charges under 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) against Ross Young on grounds relating to the destruction of a building allegedly used in or affecting interstate commerce.

 Prior to its closure, the Young Health and Fitness Center offered various commercial services and was supplied with utilities sourced across state lines. Some evidence indicated that utility services continued for a period following closure and that Ross Young remained on the company payroll for a brief time. Prosecutors and defense counsel each provided differing viewpoints as to whether the building, though temporarily shut down, maintained the requisite nexus with interstate commerce.

 The United States contends that the building fell within the purview of 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) due to its connection to commerce affecting multiple states. In support, the United States points to congressional authority under the Commerce Clause, noting that courts have consistently interpreted 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) broadly to include structures used for commercial purposes. The United States cites precedents, including Russell v. United States, for the proposition that property with any demonstrable commercial character—even if temporarily vacant—can meet the “used in interstate or foreign commerce” requirement. The United States further emphasizes that the ownership by a Kansas resident, potential sale on a broad commercial market, and out-of-state utility supply are each factors that can satisfy the statutory element of affecting interstate commerce. Additionally, it argues that the fatal consequences of the fire were reasonably foreseeable, invoking language in 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) regarding proximate cause, and maintaining that any substantial factor leading to the firefighters’ deaths is enough to establish liability.

 Ross Young responds that 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) should not extend to a structure that was closed and inactive at the time of the blaze. He relies on a narrower reading of the Commerce Clause, asserting that the building’s mere potential for commercial activity, without actual ongoing operations, is insufficient to satisfy the “used in any activity affecting interstate commerce” element. Certain appellate decisions suggesting that purely local uses of property or minimal activities are inadequate under federal law bolster Ross Young’s view. He also challenges whether it was reasonably foreseeable that firefighters would die battling the fire, contending that any chain of causation was interrupted by multiple intervening factors. On these bases, he maintains that, however the tragedy unfolded, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) as traditionally construed does not cover a circumstance of inactivity coupled with only an attenuated tie to commerce.
