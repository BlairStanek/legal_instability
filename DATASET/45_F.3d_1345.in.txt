You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A nonprofit entity, renamed here as Marigold Wellness Center, provided mental health services in a city renamed Parkston Town. Bradley was hired by Marigold Wellness Center as the interim executive director for roughly three months in late 1982. In the following spring, he formally became executive director until his contract ended at the close of June 1983.

 During the first quarter of 1983, Marigold Wellness Center did not pay certain withheld federal employment taxes to the Government. In the second quarter of that same year, however, the required payments were made in a timely manner. Bradley was later assessed a penalty for failing to pay over the withheld taxes from the first quarter. After paying part of that penalty, he initiated a refund proceeding, and the Government counterclaimed, seeking a judgment on the penalty.

 While preparing for the trial, the Government sent Bradley requests for admissions, but these requests were served after a court-set cutoff date. Bradley did not formally object; instead, he simply did not respond within the required timeline. As a result, the requests were deemed admitted under a procedural rule. Bradley requested to withdraw those deemed admissions, explaining that they essentially conceded liability on the core issues. The Government opposed this, pointing out that it relied on the admissions and had not conducted further discovery regarding many points. Additional criticism included the suggestion that Bradley’s delayed response was not accidental but a deliberate choice, and any late withdrawal of admissions might impact the efficient scheduling of the proceeding.

 In support of Bradley’s position, it was argued that upholding the admissions would prevent a full and fair determination of whether he was personally responsible and whether his conduct met any statutory definition of willfulness under 26 U.S.C. § 6672. It was noted that the relevant rule does allow relief from deemed admissions if doing so would serve presentation of the merits without unfairly harming the other side’s ability to prepare its case. Bradley relied on the principle that liability under 26 U.S.C. § 6672 was never intended to attach without a meaningful showing of personal fault. It was further contended that lesser remedies—such as financial sanctions, granting more time for additional discovery, or assigning costs—would be more appropriate than leaving him with no ability to dispute key issues. This approach, it was urged, would align with well-established precedent favoring the resolution of disputes on their merits whenever possible.

 In support of the Government’s position, it was maintained that Bradley’s counsel knowingly refused to respond to the requests, which were thus properly deemed admitted by operation of law. If late responses were allowed to stand, the Government claimed significant prejudice to its evidence-gathering efforts, because it had conducted its deposition and concluded other discovery in reliance on the admissions’ accuracy. The Government emphasized that a court has wide discretion to deny amendments or withdrawals of admissions under the procedural rule, particularly when a party fails to show that its lack of response was inadvertent. The Government also stressed that, once the admissions were in place, it was entitled to rely on them for trial preparation and strategy, and altering them too late would undermine the consistency and orderly management of the proceeding.
