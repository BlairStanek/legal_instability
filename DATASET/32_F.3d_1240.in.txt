You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


This case arises from a criminal proceeding in which Calvin Parks was convicted of a serious offense carrying a potential death sentence. Parks had been represented by the same attorney, Andrew Hill, from the early stages of the prosecution through trial, direct appeal, post-conviction proceedings in the state courts, and an initial federal habeas corpus proceeding. Late in the process, Parks sought to replace Andrew Hill with Sam Fisher, an attorney from New York. Parks wanted to pursue new claims that had not been raised previously.

 One of Parks’s contentions is that Andrew Hill was ineffective by making damaging concessions during the jury argument, including an acknowledgment that Parks participated in events leading to a killing. Another contention is that Hill omitted a statutory mitigating factor at sentencing, namely that Parks lacked significant prior criminal exposure. Parks claims he did not realize he could challenge Hill’s performance until Sam Fisher entered the case and explained there could be grounds for relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel.

 Several filings were made urgently, close to Parks’s scheduled execution date. During this same time, Parks did not attend a clemency-related hearing, and he also changed lawyers shortly before the date set for execution. Parks argues that, because Andrew Hill had always been his lawyer, he had no meaningful opportunity to raise ineffective-assistance claims sooner. At the same time, questions were raised about whether Parks’s last-minute substitution of counsel was a delay tactic, whether he had waived certain arguments by participating in earlier proceedings without raising them, and whether any unraised claims were now procedurally barred.

 The strongest legal arguments for the first party (the State) emphasize that Parks, having completed one federal habeas round without raising ineffective-assistance concerns, should be held to procedural rules prohibiting repetitious litigation or defaulted claims. These arguments rely on doctrines barring second or successive petitions and on the principle that claims waived or omitted in prior proceedings cannot ordinarily be revived. The State also points to longstanding precedent holding that a mere change of counsel does not excuse procedural bars. Furthermore, the State relies on standards of reasonable diligence, noting that in federal habeas practice, untimeliness can defeat a request for new claims at a late hour.

 The strongest legal arguments for the other party (Parks) emphasize that he was never provided counsel free from a personal conflict of interest to assess whether his trial representation was constitutionally deficient. Citing McFarland v. Scott and other cases, Parks argues that he is entitled to conflict-free representation to investigate potential constitutional claims thoroughly. Parks also relies on Strickland v. Washington, contending that the trial record suggests Hill may have offered substandard performance by admitting guilt in the jury’s presence and by failing to argue mitigating factors. According to Parks, these actions, along with Hill’s inability to challenge his own effectiveness, show cause and prejudice for any default and warrant a fresh opportunity to present his ineffectiveness claims.
