You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Greenwood Insurance, Inc. entered into multiple reinsurance arrangements, under which it undertook obligations originally held by primary insurers. Later, Greenwood Insurance, Inc. executed a broader agreement with Brightstar Re, Inc., called the Shared Liability Agreement, whereby Brightstar Re, Inc. reinsured a wide array of Greenwood Insurance, Inc.’s outstanding exposures stemming from hundreds of reinsurance contracts. Disagreements arose between these parties concerning the proper division of payment responsibilities as well as the implications of various sub-contracts and previous insurance agreements that Greenwood Insurance, Inc. had in place.

 One area of controversy related to the Calido Excess Reinsurance Arrangement, an earlier agreement covering specific layers of claims. Under that arrangement, Greenwood Insurance, Inc. would pay a certain initial amount of each covered claim, with further portions to be paid by the provider of the Calido Excess Reinsurance Arrangement. A key question centered on whether Greenwood Insurance, Inc. or Brightstar Re, Inc. had to front the funds for these claims before seeking recovery from the Calido Excess Reinsurance Arrangement provider. The stakes were heightened by the concern over potential insolvency of that provider, leading to disputes about which entity ultimately bore the financial risk. Arbitration proceedings addressed these issues, and the parties debated whether Greenwood Insurance, Inc. should satisfy certain requirements before obtaining reimbursement from Brightstar Re, Inc.

 Another dispute concerned Greenwood Insurance, Inc.’s dealings with Alliance Surplus Lines Insurance Co., for which Greenwood Insurance, Inc. had provided reinsurance and was itself reinsured by Brightstar Re, Inc. Greenwood Insurance, Inc. halted some payments to Alliance Surplus Lines Insurance Co. for a period and later entered arbitration with that company, culminating in a settlement. When Brightstar Re, Inc. sought additional information regarding the reasons behind Greenwood Insurance, Inc.’s partial nonpayment and the nature of the arbitration with Alliance Surplus Lines Insurance Co., Greenwood Insurance, Inc. declined to disclose specific materials. Because of that refusal, Brightstar Re, Inc. questioned its continued obligation under the Shared Liability Agreement, citing the lack of transparency and hinting that it might justify rescission or a similar remedy. The outcome of the arbitration mentioned conditions under which future claims might or might not be paid, and whether those claims could be reopened if certain evidence were later produced.

 Brightstar Re, Inc. argues, based on the clauses in the Shared Liability Agreement and general principles derived from cases such as Sheet Metal Workers Int’l Ass’n v. Arizona Mechanical & Stainless, Inc. and Local Joint Exec. Bd. of Las Vegas v. Riverboat Casino, Inc., that arbitrators possess the authority to craft conditions that reflect and enforce the parties’ obligations of good faith. Brightstar Re, Inc. maintains that when contracts are silent or ambiguous about precisely how reimbursements occur, arbitral tribunals may impose practical prerequisites—especially if there is concern about solvency or undisclosed information. Brightstar Re, Inc. also contends that under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4) and related precedent, any remedy that remains tied to the language of the agreement or to industry custom is within the arbitrators’ jurisdiction—particularly if it ensures that the party requesting reimbursement demonstrates the clarity and thoroughness necessary for proper payment.

 Greenwood Insurance, Inc. counters that the Shared Liability Agreement contains no explicit framework authorizing the imposition of newly crafted conditions or restrictions on reimbursement. Citing cases interpreting contract-based arbitration, such as Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp. and American Hosp. Supply Corp. v. Hospital Products Ltd., Greenwood Insurance, Inc. urges that the remedy for a breach cannot exceed the scope of the underlying bargain. Greenwood Insurance, Inc. contends that by fashioning conditions not found in the written contract, any arbitral award would inappropriately rewrite the parties’ agreement. Greenwood Insurance, Inc. notes that damages must be based on concrete evidence rather than speculation and asserts that, absent precise factual proof, measures barring legitimate future claims improperly penalize a party seeking routine coverage. Greenwood Insurance, Inc. also argues that a complete bar on future claims or extensive prerequisites improperly overcompensates an opposing party, as it would go beyond correcting any breach and, in effect, alter the fundamental risk allocation the Shared Liability Agreement was originally designed to achieve.
