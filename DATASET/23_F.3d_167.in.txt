You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


River Reese is a private individual who had previously been granted a third-class airman’s medical certificate to fly private airplanes. After receiving renewals in prior years, he began taking lithium on a daily basis to manage mild bipolar mood disorder symptoms, which he referred to as mild mood swings. Around the same time, he also briefly used Ritalin for concentration issues but subsequently stopped. When he applied again for a third-class certificate, he disclosed his use of lithium.

 The Federal Aviation Administration declined to renew River Reese’s certificate on grounds that his lithium usage, coupled with the condition for which it was prescribed, rendered him unfit to pilot an aircraft. Citing safety concerns, the agency pointed to potential lithium toxicity—such as blurred vision, balance problems, memory issues, and other physical side effects—as well as the possibility of “breakthrough” episodes in which the underlying bipolar condition might recur. Reese sought reconsideration, and when that failed, he petitioned the National Transportation Safety Board for review.

 During the proceeding, testimony from multiple medical experts focused on the interplay between the underlying bipolar disorder and the effects of lithium. Part of the testimony reflected the view that, with consistent monitoring of medication levels, lithium could stabilize mild mood swings and might pose little risk to flight safety. Yet other evidence highlighted the dangers of improperly monitored lithium levels, aggregate fatigue from long flights, and the risk of unpredictable swings in mood. Those opposing the renewed certificate argued that these risks, taken together, outweighed any benefit from medicating the condition. Those supporting the renewed certificate asserted that denying it based solely on lithium use could ignore whether Reese actually functioned safely under stable treatment.

 One set of arguments for River Reese centers on the reading of the applicable law and regulations, which, in this view, do not explicitly disqualify individuals based on the mere fact of taking lithium. These arguments claim that the regulations focus on an applicant’s underlying “organic, functional or structural disease, defect, or limitation,” not on the name of a prescribed drug. They further assert that adopting a blanket rule against lithium usage is effectively creating an unpublished or improperly promulgated requirement. Citing precedent such as Morton v. Ruiz for the principle that agencies must not enforce hidden or unannounced policies, Reese’s position reasons that an agency seeking to reject all lithium users should do so through formal rulemaking. Finally, Reese contends that refusing the certificate because of lithium use overlooks the fact that he is addressing his bipolar condition responsibly, which under other anti-discrimination principles (including those in the Rehabilitation Act) may imply that he is capable of performing the pilot’s role with suitable medical oversight.

 Another set of arguments, supporting the National Transportation Safety Board’s stance, relies on the broad safety mandate of federal aviation provisions, including 14 C.F.R. § 67.17, to deny medical certificates to those whose condition or treatment poses a real danger to safe piloting. These arguments maintain that the risk of lithium toxicity—such as dehydration elevating lithium levels in flight—alone warrants heightened caution. Moreover, the possibility of a breakthrough of the underlying bipolar disorder, with potential symptoms that might emerge without warning, is seen as incompatible with the demands of even a third-class certificate. According to this perspective, the agency is entitled to decide that certain medications, by definition, involve too high a level of unpredictability or side effects. These arguments further assert that the policy was disseminated through a series of published adjudications, thus not constituting a secret rule, and that it is within the agency’s discretion to choose adjudication as a proper mechanism to interpret and apply existing regulations in fulfilling aviation safety objectives.
