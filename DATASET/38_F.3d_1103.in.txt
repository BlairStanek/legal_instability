You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In the period leading up to the events at issue, Leon West was introduced to Agent Logan, an undercover member of the DEA, through Anthony Cross. Anthony Cross had been serving a lengthy federal prison sentence and was working on behalf of the government as a confidential informant, with no direct supervision over how he contacted individuals. According to various statements, Anthony Cross repeatedly encouraged Leon West to arrange a large drug transaction. At the time, Leon West was experiencing severe financial hardship, lacked stable housing, and occasionally obtained temporary employment. During their discussions, Leon West initially proposed a smaller deal, but Anthony Cross and Agent Logan pressed him to procure a significantly larger quantity.

 After numerous conversations, Leon West ultimately arrived with the agreed supply of an illicit substance, allegedly much greater in quantity than any he had handled before. Leon West himself gave testimony at trial that, in the past, he had only ever participated in a far smaller exchange involving the same substance, using most of it personally and sharing a few doses with acquaintances. The transaction that Anthony Cross arranged with Agent Logan was conducted so that Leon West would provide thousands of doses in a single sale, at a price that had been negotiated. There was also discussion of raising the promised payment if Leon West hesitated.

 During the subsequent proceedings, Leon West contended that he was pushed into a much larger operation by the actions of the confidential informant, suggesting that he would otherwise not have engaged in a transaction of that scale. A jury nonetheless found him responsible for possessing the illicit substance with intent to distribute it. Leon West also requested that the informant’s identity be disclosed, arguing it was relevant to his claim that he had been induced. The court considered the weight of both the drug itself and the carrier medium in calculating the applicable sentencing range. Leon West argued that the sentence was disproportionately severe relative to his earlier history, which involved only minor drug sales, although he conceded distributing small amounts in the past.

 Leon West asserts that various constitutional and statutory provisions, including 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) and the policy statements referenced in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, should allow a reduction based on the circumstances of his involvement. He highlights that he had never participated in a transaction of this magnitude, was induced by a repeated government request to supply more product than he ever intended, and was struggling financially in ways the government was aware of. He points to jurisprudence suggesting that fairness demands considering how much a suspect was predisposed to partake in a certain level of criminality. He also invokes decisions applying Jacobson v. United States and related precedents on investigative overreach, contending that these authorities show how a court can address large-scale transactions that arise primarily from continued inducement.

 The United States responds that Leon West showed elements of prior familiarity with the substance, evinced by his admission of having purchased and sold portions on earlier occasions. It maintains that the government’s actions were a standard investigative measure, and that Leon West willingly agreed to the transaction when negotiations placed him in a position to accept or refuse. The United States cites a variety of appellate rulings indicating there is no requirement for the government to lower a proposed quantity or price when a suspect appears ready to participate. It contends that Leon West’s arguments regarding reduction in sentencing are not supported by the guidelines, arguing that he was ultimately responsible for the amount he brought and that the confidential informant’s influence does not, on its own, warrant a departure from the advisory range set forth by the guidelines or controlling interpretations of Chapman v. United States and related authority.
