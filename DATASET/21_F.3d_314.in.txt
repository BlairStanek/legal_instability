You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


IndividualX is a person who arrived in the United States during a large influx of arrivals from CitySix, located in a foreign country. At the time of entry, IndividualX was considered an excluded individual under the nation’s immigration laws. After living in the United States for a period, IndividualX was convicted of a series of offenses in Florida, including burglary and robbery. Following these convictions, the Immigration and Naturalization Service took the position that IndividualX posed a danger and detained IndividualX in various federal prison facilities located in CityOne, CityTwo, CityThree, and CityFour. The facilities ranged from medium to high security.

 Detention continued for years because IndividualX’s home country would not accept a return, and no other nation was found to be willing to receive IndividualX. The United States, confronting difficulties in carrying out deportation, kept IndividualX in physical custody. The question arose whether detaining IndividualX in a high-security setting for such an extended duration was permissible under the immigration statutes and the Constitution. Both IndividualX and the United States focused on the length and conditions of the confinement, especially because IndividualX remained in close custody alongside those serving criminal sentences.

 IndividualX’s situation was further complicated by allegations of possible dangerousness, including the prior criminal record. At one point, IndividualX was paroled under supervision but was subsequently taken into custody again based on a new allegation. Meanwhile, the United States maintained that it had authority to continue confining IndividualX for regulatory, non-punitive reasons. IndividualX argued that this indefinite custody amounted to punishment and exceeded what the immigration statutes allowed. The United States took the position that without the power to detain, it would have no effective means to enforce exclusion where removal remained impracticable.

 In support of IndividualX, arguments drew on constitutional protections that apply to every person within the sovereign’s jurisdiction, even if excluded under immigration law. One contention was that indefinite confinement in facilities built for criminal punishment goes far beyond a mere regulatory measure. References were made to case law and statutory provisions suggesting that any detention beyond a certain point could become “excessive” relative to immigration goals. Arguments invoked various constitutional principles, including due process, to suggest that no statute clearly grants unlimited authority to keep an excluded individual imprisoned. Certain provisions of Title 8 of the United States Code were construed to show that while the government can detain someone in preparation for deportation, nothing in those statutes supports potentially perpetual imprisonment. The discussion also emphasized that where the law is ambiguous, courts should avoid construing it in a manner that risks violating basic constitutional safeguards.

 In favor of the United States, arguments focused on the statutory framework that extends express discretion to the Attorney General to parole, detain, or deport excluded individuals. Proponents stressed that immediate deportation is the default but may not be feasible when foreign governments refuse to accept their nationals. They pointed out that federal statutes explicitly mention detention expenses and costs, indicating that Congress envisioned some individuals could be held for substantial periods when deportation could not be immediately effected. Supporters also cited established precedent recognizing that excluded individuals, unlike admissible residents or citizens, may be subjected to confinement if parole is deemed inappropriate. Further, references to key decisions were made to demonstrate that courts have historically upheld extended detention for excluded persons. The United States contended that protecting the public from potentially dangerous individuals is essential, and nothing in the statutes compels release after a fixed time. Ultimately, reliance was placed on the government’s duty to safeguard society and on regulations that provide for periodic review of parole decisions.
