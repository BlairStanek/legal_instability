You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


According to the record, the first party was preparing to board a flight bound for Mexico when a customs inspector stopped him at Herontown International Airport to inquire about the amount of currency he was carrying. The first party allegedly informed the inspector that he had around five or six thousand dollars, which he produced, but the inspector subsequently found additional cash concealed in his belongings. All told, the currency exceeded fifty thousand dollars. The first party was placed under arrest and later indicted for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.

 Later proceedings concentrated on how the first party’s reported statements contrasted with what the inspector uncovered. At the time the first party produced a smaller amount of money to the inspector, he allegedly denied carrying more. The customs inspector asked multiple times about additional funds and was told there were none. When the first party’s bag was opened, the inspector located several bundles of currency. The discovery led to formal charges based on the premise that the first party knowingly made a false statement about the amount of money he was carrying.

 When the first party appeared in the district court for sentencing, a presentence report recommended using certain parts of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The first party disagreed with the choice of the particular guideline and took the position that a different guideline more accurately described the conduct at issue. The Government argued in response that the guideline selected was the one most directly applicable, given that the United States has a legitimate interest in preventing unreported exportation of large sums of currency.

 The first party’s arguments emphasized that his conduct should be viewed primarily as a false statement not intended to deprive the Government of revenue, taxes, or duty. He reasoned that the guideline normally used for straightforward fraudulent misrepresentations under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 would properly apply. In making this argument, the first party focused on language in certain commentary discussing how, where a more general false statement is involved, one “fraud and deceit” provision can be appropriate under certain circumstances. The first party also pointed to case law, including references to United States v. Carillo-Hernandez and Stinson v. United States, to suggest that guidelines covering import or export restrictions could require careful alignment with the facts. He maintained that the absence of any direct intent to conceal revenue from the Government strongly favored the approach that treats such misrepresentations as routine false statement offenses.

 The Government’s arguments stressed that the guidelines relating to reporting monetary instruments, and the statutory provisions behind them, reflect the serious interest in monitoring substantial sums of currency leaving the country. The Government pointed to features of guidelines that address the failure to disclose large sums of money during border crossings. These guidelines, in the Government’s view, were drafted precisely because false statements about currency in transit create significant policy concerns connected to money laundering, illegal activity, or evasion of reporting obligations. The Government drew on reasoning from other cases, underscoring that the first party’s repeated responses to the customs inspector suggested a deliberate attempt to hide a large amount of currency. It maintained that the guidelines explicitly aimed at reporting requirements provided a more fitting framework than a generic fraud provision might.
