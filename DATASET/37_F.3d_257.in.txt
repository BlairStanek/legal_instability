You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Kevin Woods was prosecuted in Illinois for murder after a shooting incident near an apartment complex. According to one account by Samuel Pierce, Mr. Woods approached a group that had been drinking near several mailboxes. During a tense exchange, Mr. Woods pulled out a gun and fired it as Michael Reyes fled. Mr. Woods then left the area. Mr. Reyes later died from a gunshot wound to the back of his head.  

 Mr. Woods described a conflicting version of events. He claimed that earlier the same evening, Mr. Reyes and two other individuals, including Tyler Bennett, had tried to intimidate him. Mr. Woods said he retrieved a gun because he was worried those individuals might still be around. He returned to the mailboxes to drop off misaddressed letters and felt threatened when he saw a silhouette he believed to be Mr. Reyes holding something in a “striking position.” Mr. Woods claimed that he drew the gun only to scare Mr. Reyes away, then accidentally discharged the weapon when he stumbled into the mailboxes. After the shot, he immediately went upstairs to speak with Mrs. Pierce, to whom he handed the gun.

 Law enforcement officials recounted that Mr. Woods did not initially mention any accidental bump against the mailboxes. In a statement before trial, Mr. Woods said he fired the gun because he was afraid Mr. Reyes was going to hit him again, referencing a past altercation in which Mr. Reyes allegedly struck him with a soda bottle. The trial record also contained testimony that Mr. Reyes appeared intoxicated and might have been insulting Mr. Woods, yet others did not see a physical attack on Mr. Woods that night. At trial, the court instructed the jury on murder and involuntary manslaughter but declined to give instructions on self-defense or voluntary manslaughter.

 Jordan Davis argues that withholding the self-defense and voluntary manslaughter instructions was justified under established precedent and statutory provisions regarding the use of force in defense of a person. He contends that, under the relevant Illinois statute, any additional instructions based on self-defense or unreasonable belief in the need for deadly force must be supported by evidence that the defendant feared imminent death or great bodily harm. In his view, Mr. Woods’s own description of events does not supply that evidentiary foundation because he acknowledged that Mr. Reyes was running away at the time the weapon discharged. Citing case law that limits the right to self-defense instructions to circumstances of clear imminent danger, Jordan Davis also maintains that any mention of a possible accidental discharge signals a lack of intentional self-defense. Furthermore, he invokes decisions suggesting that a trial court’s decision can be deemed sound if the factual record doesn’t show a necessary factual element of self-defense or voluntary manslaughter. Drawing on cases addressing harmless trial errors, Jordan Davis emphasizes that there must be a significant possibility the omission of instructions influenced the jury’s verdict to require separate defenses or lesser-included offenses. Because, in his view, any inference supporting immediate peril is speculative, no additional instructions were warranted under relevant federal and state law.

 Kevin Woods counters that, according to federal and state precedent, defendants are entitled to jury instructions on any defense fairly supported by the record. He maintains that his testimony—particularly about his fear of being struck again, the recollection that a previous bottle attack had already occurred, and the immediate circumstances suggesting Mr. Reyes held a can in a raised position—provides enough evidentiary support to merit an instruction on self-defense. He further contends that the fact he claimed an unintentional discharge does not preclude a finding that he believed deadly force might be needed, citing cases where courts have permitted instructions on both accident and self-defense in the same trial. To him, the statutory language for voluntary manslaughter also allows for an unreasonable belief in the necessity of deadly force, and the jury should have been allowed to consider whether he acted out of fear, even if that fear was not objectively reasonable. Mr. Woods therefore argues that the trial court’s refusal to give the instruction on self-defense or voluntary manslaughter violated his constitutional rights, insofar as he was denied a jury’s full consideration of all plausible defenses under the relevant statutory framework.
