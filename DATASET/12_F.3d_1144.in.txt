You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Orion Enterprises is an Ohio-based corporation that sent out unsolicited advertisements offering a program to train people to find and liquidate excess merchandise. For an initial fee of $164, purchasers of this program would receive a manual and cassette tapes describing how to locate surplus goods and arrange profitable sales. The Postal Service took the view that these mailings contained certain representations about the quality and completeness of Orion Enterprises’ training materials, as well as the amount of money that could be earned without further payments.

 In the materials sent by Orion Enterprises, potential customers were told that they could begin making large sums of money quickly after receiving the program. The manual referenced additional services and products that could be purchased at extra cost, such as a separate guidebook and membership in an association for liquidators. Some who received the manual understood it to convey that the extra services were not mandatory, while others believed that those services and products were described as critical for achieving substantial financial success. At least one witness, renamed here as Alexis Dunn, testified to having some success without buying extra services.

 According to the Postal Service’s complaint, Orion Enterprises made statements suggesting that participants would be comprehensively trained and could rely on Orion Enterprises’ assistance to profit in the thousands of dollars solely through the initial materials. Orion Enterprises, on the other hand, maintained that the main manual and tapes contained everything a novice needed to launch a profitable venture. However, there was also promotional text indicating that additional books, memberships, and certification might enhance a participant’s success in finding buyers for merchandise or in receiving consultation services. The Postal Service placed certain funds related to Orion Enterprises’ mailings in escrow during the dispute, which included administrative proceedings and subsequent review in the district court.

 In arguing that Orion Enterprises’ mail solicitation violated 39 U.S.C. § 3005, the Postal Service relies on legal principles stating that false representations in offers sent through the mail can constitute a prohibited practice when they mislead ordinary recipients. It cites authorities including Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc. and Peak Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Postal Serv. to stress that advertisements must be judged by how typical readers would interpret them. From this perspective, repeatedly highlighting that the manual alone would enable quick success, while also depicting various paid add-ons as vital or “must-have,” could be seen as a contradiction. The Postal Service points to statements in the manual that allegedly undercut the initial claims, suggesting that customers would be compelled to purchase extra services to realize the promised results. Under this view, the appearance of such contradictions within a single course of dealing signals that the original mail pieces were misleading and therefore actionable under the statute. Furthermore, the Postal Service references the position that misrepresentations need not deceive every consumer or cause actual loss; it is enough that they have a tendency to mislead the average person.

 Orion Enterprises contends that its mail solicitations were neither literally false nor materially deceptive. Relying on interpretations of 39 U.S.C. § 3005 and judicial precedents such as Silver v. United States Postal Serv. and Farley v. Heininger, Orion Enterprises argues that it delivered precisely what was promised in the mailings: a self-contained instructional system capable of generating thousands of dollars without any extra purchase. According to Orion Enterprises, the evidence showed that at least some purchasers earned substantial sums using the manual and tapes alone. The firm further asserts that suggestions of additional products or memberships do not negate the fundamental truthfulness of the initial representation; a person could opt not to buy further services and still liquidate merchandise profitably through the detailed steps laid out in the manual. In this view, what Orion Enterprises characterizes as “enhancements”—the extra guidebook, association membership, and telephone consultations—do not invalidate the underlying claim that the first payment secures a stand-alone course, and that providing a supplemental product line does not by itself make the original promises false or misleading.
