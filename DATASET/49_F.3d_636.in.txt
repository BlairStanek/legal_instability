You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Law enforcement officials from a county sheriff’s office, the Kansas National Guard, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation were participating in a marijuana eradication operation. They spotted marijuana plants while conducting aerial surveillance in a residential yard located in Hillsby County. Officer observations from a nearby sports field confirmed the plants were being cultivated, and agents then obtained a search warrant for the house belonging to Liam Johnson.

 Upon executing the search warrant, agents found 142 marijuana plants in a fenced area of the backyard. Additional marijuana was discovered inside the home. They also located a .22 caliber semiautomatic rifle equipped with a homemade silencer, along with a second homemade silencer in partial stages of assembly. Liam Johnson promptly acknowledged responsibility, asserting that the marijuana was only for his personal use and that he neither sold nor distributed it. He also elaborated on his ongoing struggles with marijuana dependency.

 A jury concluded that Liam Johnson had possessed the marijuana, along with unregistered firearms and firearms that lacked identifying serial numbers, in violation of applicable federal laws. Evidence showed that the homemade silencers consisted of common household items—such as cardboard tubes and stuffing from toys—and were intended for use with the rifle found on the premises. Liam Johnson’s personal history included past psychiatric treatment and sole custodial responsibility for his minor child, Noah Johnson. Testimony and reports submitted at sentencing indicated that, despite multiple past marriages and a complex family situation, he was the primary caretaker of Noah Johnson, whose well-being and academic performance had reportedly declined during any prolonged separation from his father.

 In support of its position, the Government points to statutory requirements governing registration and identification of certain firearms under federal law, including silencers, referencing prohibitions on possessing unregistered firearms as outlined in specific firearm legislation. It also cites guidelines that presume family ties and responsibilities ordinarily do not warrant altering a sentence. The Government emphasizes that mandatory terms for firearm violations apply even when items may appear improvised or when an accused individual claims purely personal motives. Additionally, it contends that federal sentencing policy usually integrates any mental health considerations within the existing framework, so separate downward adjustments would require a showing of extraordinary circumstances.

 Arguing for a different outcome, Liam Johnson underscores that his manufactured silencers were rudimentary devices, suggesting minimal sophistication and reduced harm relative to typical prohibited silencers. He also highlights his nonviolent personal history, his immediate cooperation with authorities, and his lack of prior distribution activities or intent to sell. Further, he insists that severe mental health challenges and the critical nature of his role as the primary caregiver for his child merit discretionary leniency. Under relevant sentencing provisions, he asserts that unusual family ties and personal circumstances—especially with psychiatric factors and childcare—can provide valid grounds to deviate from the standard sentencing range.
