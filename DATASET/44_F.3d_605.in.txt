You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Thatcher Transport and Warehouse is a company based in Morgan Falls, Illinois, engaging in the moving and storage of goods. Over time, it has employed a varying number of individuals in roles covered by a labor contract. Transport Operators and Related Workers, Local No. 999 is a labor organization that had historically represented some of Thatcher Transport and Warehouse’s workers. Thatcher Transport and Warehouse belonged to the Carriers’ Council of Greenham, which negotiated collective bargaining agreements on behalf of its members with Local No. 999. One such contract included both a favored nations clause and a union security clause requiring employees to become union members within thirty days of employment.

 Despite these contractual provisions, Thatcher Transport and Warehouse did not enroll all employees in Local No. 999’s benefit plans. Instead, only some of the individuals working in bargaining-unit positions were recognized for union membership, and pension and welfare contributions were made only for those recognized members. Local No. 999’s leadership did not file any grievances against this approach for several years. Later, however, certain union representatives signed up additional workers as members, and those workers expected to be covered under the contract’s benefits as well. Around this time, Local No. 999 requested a list of wages, hours, and related information for all employees in the bargaining unit so the union could assess how the contract was being administered.

 Negotiations over a new agreement ensued as the existing contract approached expiration. Thatcher Transport and Warehouse asked for any other labor contracts that might have offered more favorable terms, pointing to the favored nations clause. Meanwhile, Local No. 999 maintained that it needed additional employee information concerning wages and hours to verify that the collective bargaining agreement was being properly applied to workers performing the relevant tasks. Thatcher Transport and Warehouse later declared that negotiations were at an impasse, publicly announcing an intent to implement various terms of its last offer. During a meeting of employees, the company stated it could permanently replace anyone who went on strike. A charge was filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging, among other things, that Thatcher Transport and Warehouse had targeted employee support for Local No. 999 and had refused to provide the requested wage and hour information. The union also took issue with whether the contract had been applied only to recognized union members.

 In support of Thatcher Transport and Warehouse’s position, it was argued that the company legitimately believed many workers did not want to join the union or claim union benefits, and that it had acted consistently with longstanding informal understandings with union leaders regarding partial coverage of employees. Proponents of the company’s view maintained that any talk of “members-only” coverage merely honored the practicality of smaller operations and that the union had tacitly accepted this limited approach for years. Additionally, they contended that once the company responded to the request for information by proposing an exchange of data, Local No. 999 let the query lapse, suggesting no genuine interest in receiving the workforce information. They also argued that any alleged statements about strike replacements were simply lawful notifications rather than attempts to discourage union membership. Finally, they claimed that references to a “members-only” arrangement were not part of the original matters raised by the union’s charge and were therefore separate from the core dispute.

 In support of the National Labor Relations Board’s position, it was argued that Thatcher Transport and Warehouse had an obligation under the existing collective bargaining agreement to cover all bargaining-unit employees and that by limiting coverage to some, the company either encouraged union membership in one way or discouraged it in another, all while failing to comply with the uniform terms required by the contract. Proponents of this view maintained that the request for workforce information was squarely related to the employer’s obligations to bargain in good faith under federal law, since the union needed that data to confirm how the contract terms were being applied. They asserted that any suggestion of permanent replacements or admonitions about union discipline could be perceived as unlawful pressure to relinquish union rights or membership. They also contended that the overall arrangement—whether it ended up favoring certain workers over others—was directly connected to the original allegations because both sets of issues turned on whether contract terms were fairly and uniformly administered to all members of the bargaining unit.
