You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


James Riley was a California prisoner who went to trial for allegedly committing two robberies at a convenience store in Rosewood, California. During jury selection in the Bayville County Superior Court, there were 26 potential jurors, from whom 12 jurors and 2 alternates would be chosen. Only one person in the panel, Ms. Summers, was African American. After some initial questioning and the use of peremptory challenges by both sides, Dan Michaels excused Ms. Summers. James Riley’s counsel objected, claiming this exclusion was racially motivated.

 Following the trial, James Riley raised complaints in the state courts. He argued that Dan Michaels had removed Ms. Summers because of her race. When challenged at trial, Dan Michaels offered explanations for his decision, including concerns about Ms. Summers’s background and her manner of answering questions. James Riley disputed these reasons. After conviction, James Riley renewed his arguments in post-trial motions, but they were rejected by the court below. He then appealed in the state system, where the issue focused on whether Ms. Summers was excused improperly. The state appellate court reviewed the record, which included Dan Michaels’s stated reasons, and also concluded there was no improper discrimination.

 Having exhausted state remedies, James Riley sought relief in federal proceedings, contending again that Ms. Summers had been struck solely because of her race. Dan Michaels testified at an evidentiary hearing, providing more details about why he had excused Ms. Summers. In turn, James Riley offered various points to show the reasons were pretextual. The district court considered the testimony, and it evaluated whether the explanations Dan Michaels gave were believable in light of the record. Both sides relied on the statements taken at trial, witness testimony, and any notes kept during jury selection.

 To support James Riley’s position under Batson v. Kentucky and related cases, several arguments were offered. First, he maintained that the removal of the only African American potential juror indicated a bias that could not be explained away by superficial references to her background. Second, James Riley pointed to inconsistencies between Dan Michaels’s recollections and Ms. Summers’s statements, arguing these inconsistencies suggested the supposed race-neutral reasons were not valid. Third, he underscored that the constitutional principle forbidding race-based peremptory challenges applies even where other factors are offered if those factors prove to be questionable or unsupported by the record. Finally, James Riley relied on interpretations of Batson that emphasize a thorough evaluation of whether explanations for a strike are pretextual, contending that the explanations did not match Ms. Summers’s actual statements and conduct.

 In response, Dan Michaels emphasized that a prosecutor may strike prospective jurors for many permissible reasons, invoking the principle that a litigant need only provide a “facially race-neutral” explanation. Relying on Batson v. Kentucky and relevant state precedents, he stressed that courts must examine the genuineness, not just the persuasiveness, of non-discriminatory reasons. He defended his decision as grounded in Ms. Summers’s employment history and the manner in which she answered questions, noting that the juror’s past involvement with certain legal matters could raise valid concerns. He also cited deference for factual determinations made by courts that directly observe voir dire, referencing the notion that a reviewing court should not second-guess credibility assessments if the record could reasonably be interpreted to support them. Lastly, Dan Michaels argued that even if race were mentioned in passing, there were sufficient non-racial motives to justify the peremptory challenge, reinforcing the idea that multiple legitimate concerns unrelated to race could prompt the strike.
