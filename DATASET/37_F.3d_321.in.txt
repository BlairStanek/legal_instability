You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Rivermill Corporation is an agricultural exporter that sought tax benefits through setting up a Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC). Under the statute at 26 U.S.C. §§ 991-997, DISC income is generally not subject to immediate federal income tax, and a portion can be deferred. The Government challenged the way Rivermill Corporation calculated and claimed this deferral, asserting that Rivermill Corporation’s pricing method overstated the DISC’s taxable income.

 Specifically, Rivermill Corporation argued it could assign to its DISC an amount equal to four percent of its gross export receipts, even when its export division had meager or no actual profit from those exports. The Government maintained that the four-percent figure could not exceed any real income earned from the export activities, and that Rivermill Corporation’s interpretation would improperly allow sheltering of domestic income in situations where the export division generated little or no profit.

 The two sides disputed the intended scope of 26 U.S.C. § 994(a)(1). Rivermill Corporation emphasized that the statute’s plain language referenced “4 percent of the qualified export receipts” without limiting the calculation to only profitable exports. The Government countered that this approach conflicted with the structure of the broader DISC scheme and with the phrase “taxable income attributable to [the export] sale,” which it viewed as capping the amount that could be shifted to the DISC. Both parties debated legislative history, with Rivermill Corporation focusing on advancing exports in general, and the Government warning that an expansive reading risked excessive shifting of otherwise taxable domestic profits.

 In support of its own position, the Government highlighted that 26 U.S.C. § 994(a) should be read to include an inherent ceiling preventing the DISC’s allocation from surpassing actual export income. It pointed to committee reports and legislative commentary that described the four-percent figure as a supplemental method intended mainly for low-margin exporters, never as a means to shelter profits from purely domestic operations. The Government argued that interpretive regulations are entitled to deference when they give effect to statutory provisions in a plausible manner. According to the Government, the phrase “taxable income attributable to such sale” in § 994(a) necessarily limits the shifting of income to what genuinely arises from exports. The Government emphasized that this interpretation fits the legislative design and curtails undue tax avoidance.

 Rivermill Corporation contended that § 994(a)(1) allowed it a straightforward, independent calculation of taxable income for DISC purposes based simply on a percentage of export receipts. It emphasized that the statutory text does not expressly require those receipts to be tied to actual profit and insisted that nothing in the language prohibited applying the four-percent figure even when the export division was unprofitable. Rivermill Corporation argued that the statutory purpose to promote exports broadly supports its reading, urging that Congress sought incentives for exports of every kind, including those with slim or nonexistent profit margins. Citing principles of statutory construction, Rivermill Corporation stressed that unambiguous terms should be applied as written, and that deferring more complicated profit-based limitations to other subsections of the statute follows Congress’s intent to encourage maximum export activity.
