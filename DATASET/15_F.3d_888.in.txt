You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Roberto Ellis worked for the INS, and Mary Chang was a non-citizen applying to the INS for a residency card. According to allegations, Ellis called Chang multiple times, suggesting that if she paid him a certain amount of money, he could assist with her application. In addition, Ellis allegedly tried to enlist Chang’s help to locate others who might also pay for similar assistance. Some of these conversations were recorded by the FBI.

 Ellis was indicted under 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(2)(A) for allegedly soliciting something of value in exchange for influencing the performance of an official act. During an interview with the FBI, Ellis at first denied requesting money from Chang. When the agents played recordings of phone calls, Ellis claimed he was personally investigating Chang’s application because he believed it to be fraudulent and wanted to see if she would offer him a bribe. Ellis later testified that he never intended to keep any money from Chang.

 At trial, the district court provided a set of instructions explaining the elements of the offense, including the requirement that Ellis must have acted “corruptly.” When the jury asked for more guidance on what “corruptly” meant, the district court reminded them to follow the earlier instructions. Ellis’s attorney had pointed to language from a prior case, suggesting that “corruptly” required a bad purpose, but the district court maintained the instructions already given. After deliberations, the jury returned its verdict, and Ellis pursued further review.

 The Government’s arguments emphasize the language of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(2)(A) and established guidance in case law stating that soliciting money or items of value for the purpose of influencing official acts qualifies as bribery when done “corruptly.” The Government interprets “corruptly” to mean acting with unlawful intent—seeking personal or improper benefit—even if the public official believes the intended act may be lawful or beneficial. The Government also relies on legal standards that do not require proof of actual authority to perform the official act or evidence that the official act would be unlawful. They point to the propriety of following recognized model jury instructions, arguing that the district court’s phrasing reflected well-settled legal definitions. The Government cites precedents that instruct courts to consider whether there was plain error or an abuse of discretion in jury instructions, and also references rules requiring an objection be stated with specificity. In doing so, the Government contends the instructions given about “corruptly” were adequate and that no additional clarification was necessary for the jury to understand the principal elements of the offense.

 Ellis’s arguments focus on the idea that the district court should have tailored the definition of “corruptly” to make clear that merely seeking financial or personal benefit is not automatically corrupt. Ellis claims that if he was acting out of a misguided attempt to uncover wrongdoing or to improve his career lawfully—rather than to keep fraudulent payments for himself—he might not meet the legal standard for “corruptly.” He cites case law and authorities that recognize “corruptly” as a nuanced term requiring genuine criminal intent or an improper scheme. He maintains the standard instructions were too general and left the jury confused about whether a hope of receiving positive recognition at work could qualify as “corrupt.” Ellis also invokes authorities holding that, when jurors explicitly ask for further guidance on a pivotal term, the trial court should offer a more concrete explanation of key statutory language. He suggests that clarifying the nature of the alleged unlawful or improper benefit would have enabled the jury to decide whether he truly intended to commit bribery or was aiming to expose wrongdoing. By pointing to the statute’s requirement of a culpable state of mind, Ellis argues the instruction should have explicitly stated that a public official must intend to keep illicit proceeds or otherwise aim to accomplish a nefarious result to qualify as acting “corruptly.”
