You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


This case centers on allegations that Ross Martin repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct against a ten-year-old relative who was his nephew. The alleged victim claimed the misconduct occurred twice, first when he was seven years old and then again when he was nine. No eyewitnesses were present, and neither side offered corroborating evidence to support or refute the accusations. Thus, the key dispute revolved around the relative credibility of Ross Martin and his nephew. The nephew’s mother, who was Ross Martin’s sibling, stated that her child reported the alleged abuse to her sometime after the second incident.

 The nephew previously lied to protect his mother in a separate incident, and Ross Martin asserted that the accusations were fabricated due to a bitter, longstanding disagreement between him and the child’s mother. During the proceedings, Ross Martin presented testimony from other family members about his character, while the government introduced minimal additional testimony—chiefly from a police officer who could not remember the details of the complaint the child and his mother had made months earlier, and from the mother’s partner, who described the close relationship the child had with his mother. Ultimately, the jury was left to determine who was telling the truth: Ross Martin or his nephew.

 Before the jury’s deliberations, the trial court gave instructions stating that the testimony of a purported victim of criminal sexual conduct need not be corroborated if believed beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court also informed the jury that there was no prejudice from allowing a designated support person to be present when a child-victim testified. Ross Martin proposed an additional set of instructions emphasizing the possibility that children, due to their youth, might be more suggestible or might fail to appreciate the gravity of their accusations. The trial court did not give these proposed instructions. Ross Martin claimed that without them, the jury would not adequately consider issues of suggestibility and family pressure.

 In support of Cameron Hunt’s position, the arguments referenced several principles. First, provisions such as 9 Guam Code Annotated § 25.40 were cited to show that the law in question specifically anticipated that corroboration might be absent and thus required no additional evidence beyond a child’s testimony if the testimony itself met the reasonable doubt threshold. Second, the notion that jurors are capable of assessing witness credibility was emphasized, referencing extensive general instructions telling jurors to consider demeanor, capacity, and any potential biases. This approach was further buttressed by statements that any alleged victim’s account was only one piece of evidence the jury must assess in light of all surrounding circumstances, and that the burden of proof remained entirely on the government. Finally, it was asserted that existing rules and precedents do not mandate that jurors receive special supplementary instructions on child witnesses, as broad credibility instructions already address how jurors should weigh all testimony.

 In support of Ross Martin’s position, the arguments focused on the unique difficulties in evaluating a child’s testimony in cases alleging sexual misconduct. Certain medical and psychological research was cited for the proposition that children might be more susceptible to suggestion or undue influence, particularly by a parent involved in a bitter family schism. Arguments pointed out that without further instruction about the risks of suggestibility and the child’s understanding of the charges’ seriousness, the jury could mistakenly give undue weight to the uncorroborated testimony of a child. Additional contentions analogized the risks inherent in relying on uncorroborated witnesses to other scenarios—like testimony from paid informants—where the law traditionally requires cautionary jury instructions. Ross Martin’s stance was that a specific directive about reviewing a child’s testimony was essential, given that this single witness’s account was the sole basis for the government’s case.
