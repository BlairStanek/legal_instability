You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On March 3, 1990, Weston Marks arrived at Hawthorn International Terminal in New York with plans to travel to Delhurst, Nigeria, concealing $145,139 in currency and $150 in traveler’s checks inside boxes of flour. When asked by an agent if he was carrying more than $10,000, Marks declared only $80 and completed a form reflecting that amount. During a search, agents discovered the concealed funds and seized them, asserting that the reporting requirements for amounts in excess of $10,000 had not been met.

 Marks was later charged under federal statutes requiring disclosure of monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 leaving the country. He pled guilty to willfully failing to report under 31 U.S.C. § 5316 and faced criminal penalties including imprisonment, supervised release, and a fine. The Government additionally initiated a forfeiture action pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5317(e), seeking the currency and traveler’s checks on grounds that the reporting requirement had been violated.

 Marks contested the forfeiture on various grounds: he emphasized that the funds could have been legally obtained and that there was no inherent danger in possessing them. He also challenged the delay in bringing the forfeiture action after the initial seizure and maintained that the forfeiture did not serve any legitimate nonpunitive objective. The Government, for its part, contended that it had provided Marks with an opportunity soon after the seizure to seek the return of the funds, which he did not effectively pursue, and that cross-border regulatory considerations gave it a substantial interest in enforcing the reporting obligations.

 The strongest legal arguments set out in the opinion for the first party winning stress the statutory mandate in 31 U.S.C. § 5316 and the specific forfeiture mechanism in 31 U.S.C. § 5317(e). These arguments assert that the property itself becomes subject to forfeiture when the necessary report is not filed, drawing support from historical forfeiture principles treating certain items as the offending “res.” Emphasizing the Government’s vital regulatory role and the resources expended to monitor movements of currency, they argue that forfeiture addresses the legitimate need for accurate cross-border reporting. They cite language in 31 U.S.C. § 5321 and 31 U.S.C. § 5322 distinguishing separate civil and criminal measures, positing that forfeiture is a remedial step aimed at securing compliance. Pointing to authority allowing the forfeiture of property used to facilitate a violation, they contend that the concealed funds constitute the direct means through which the offense was executed, in line with decisions that have upheld forfeiture in analogous contexts.

 The strongest legal arguments set out in the opinion for the other party winning focus on the claim that simply possessing or transporting monetary instruments—even if unreported—does not by itself transform the money into illegal or harmful property. They assert that the principal wrongdoing is the omission to file a form, rather than an unlawful or dangerous use of funds. These arguments maintain that the forfeiture is disproportionate and punitive because it severs any link to actual harm or regulatory expense, going beyond remedial action into pure punishment. They highlight analogous situations where lawful ownership of unreported property would not typically be deemed contraband subject to forfeiture. Additionally, they stress that a monetary fine already addresses the costs and deterrence associated with the failure to report, contending that a full confiscation exceeds any legitimate remedial objective that the statute might otherwise serve. By characterizing the forfeiture as a second penalty lacking a civil function, these arguments seek to show that the measure is better viewed as punitive in nature, thus undermining its validity as a remedial mechanism.
