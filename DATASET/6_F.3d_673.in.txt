You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Early one morning, a phone call to the local sheriff’s office reported that a man had fired a weapon at a public campground near Forest Lake. Two officers drove toward the campground and encountered a car leaving the area. The occupants of that car stated that an individual named Julian White was harming people there, and that gunshots had been heard. The officers then spoke with a pedestrian named Jackson Reed, who claimed that White discharged a firearm in Reed’s direction some time after a physical altercation.

 The officers arrived at the campground close to daybreak. They learned from another individual that White and a woman, Lucy Hill, were in a tent on the premises. White had apparently lived in that tent for a few days. The officers approached without a warrant, called White out of the tent, and arrested him. White was then placed in a police vehicle stationed roughly 20 yards from the tent. The officers removed Hill from the tent, conversed with other campers for several minutes, and later searched inside the tent without a warrant. In the course of that search, they discovered a loaded handgun under an air mattress.

 White eventually faced federal charges for unlawful firearm possession. Following a trial, White raised challenges to the officers’ actions, including whether the arrest required a warrant, whether there was any need for an immediate search of the tent, and whether the tent should be given the same consideration as other residences. Some facts centered on whether the officers had information that White was asleep in the tent and the extent to which they believed they were acting in light of an immediate threat. Other facts concerned the length of time between the reported altercation and the arrest, as well as the level of quiet observed at the campground once the officers arrived.

 In support of the position favoring the United States, it was argued that the officers had information suggesting a serious and ongoing danger at the campground, including a reported firearm discharge and allegations of physical harm. It was emphasized that public safety and the safety of the officers themselves must be paramount when a credible threat has been described, especially when the suspect is believed to be armed in a location accessible to other people. The United States cited principles from established Supreme Court case law addressing scenarios in which law enforcement may act without a warrant to prevent harm. In particular, general doctrines on warrantless arrests and searches were referenced, underscoring that urgency, combined with a reliable indication of the suspect’s potential to commit further violence, would justify immediate intervention. The United States also stressed that the reported firearm possession and recent discharge elevated the risk, making rapid police action permissible under longstanding Fourth Amendment precedents.

 In support of the position favoring Julian White, it was argued that the place where the arrest and search occurred was effectively his dwelling—even if temporary—and, under established precedent, a person’s privacy interest in a dwelling is protected to the highest degree under the Fourth Amendment. White’s supporters contended that no credible basis existed for bypassing ordinary warrant requirements, especially since significant time had passed between the initial incident and the arrest. They cited case law holding that law enforcement generally must secure a warrant before entering a location treated as someone’s home, absent clear evidence of an imminent threat. White’s advocates also stated that the officers did not observe any ongoing disturbance when they arrived, pointing to the peaceful state of the campground and the opportunity to obtain a warrant without risking public safety. They likewise questioned whether the government could show any urgent need to search the tent, highlighting case authority that resting firearms alone does not excuse law enforcement from satisfying the Fourth Amendment’s warrant prerequisites.
