You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A group of individuals in Ohio, referred to here as The Gaines Class, had been receiving funds under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program before qualifying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). By operation of law, a person cannot receive both AFDC and SSI benefits at the same time, so once people in The Gaines Class became eligible for SSI, their AFDC benefits were supposed to stop. The Secretary of Health and Human Services oversees the SSI program. Members of The Gaines Class claimed that in the first one or two months of switching to SSI, their AFDC benefits were still counted as income even though those benefits had ended, resulting in reduced SSI payments. Several individuals—among them Alyssa Ryan, Alex Martin, Sam Parker, and Tina Brown—brought suit, seeking relief for what they believed were underpayments and requesting that the Secretary address this through a regulation.

 Before the events in question, SSI was generally calculated using what is known as retrospective monthly accounting (RMA). Under RMA, the SSI payment for a given month depends on income a person received a prior month or two. This method was introduced to reduce overpayments and simplify the administrative process. However, The Gaines Class argued that RMA produced a “glitch” when transitioning from AFDC to SSI: AFDC income from a past month, they maintained, was counted toward SSI even though they no longer actually received AFDC. The Gaines Class alleged that some people ended up with total benefits lower than what they otherwise should have received, especially for the first or second month of SSI eligibility.

 During the litigation, The Gaines Class sought to compel the Secretary to issue a regulation under 42 U.S.C. § 1382(c)(4), sometimes referred to as the “reliable information exception,” claiming it required using promptly available data to avoid inaccurate benefit amounts. The Gaines Class also asked a district court in Ohio to retroactively restore any missed payments. The Secretary contended that the statutory provision allowed but did not require the issuance of a special rule exempting RMA in these circumstances. Additionally, the Secretary challenged whether certain members of The Gaines Class had met procedural requirements in bringing their claims.

 In support of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it was argued that the retrospective monthly accounting system was formally enacted by Congress to address accuracy and cost concerns, as reflected in provisions introduced by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. Under that framework, an individual’s benefits are usually tied to what was actually received in a prior month. Authorities like Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. were cited for the principle that an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its governing statute is entitled to considerable deference, including the agency’s view of the “reliable information exception.” The Secretary’s supporters emphasized that the statutory text of 42 U.S.C. § 1382(c)(4) allows, but does not necessarily compel, a regulatory approach taking immediate changes in income into account. They also stressed that any alternative to RMA could reintroduce errors and complexity, precisely the problems that RMA was designed to reduce.

 In support of The Gaines Class, it was argued that 42 U.S.C. § 1382(c)(4) functions as more than a voluntary permission slip—specifically, that it mandates the Secretary to issue a regulation so that known variations in income for certain months are promptly reflected in SSI payments. They asserted that when the Secretary is aware, by operation of law, that AFDC benefits have ended, counting those benefits under the retrospective system contradicts the statute’s purpose to measure an individual’s true monthly income. They referred to legislative history suggesting that the reliable information exception was intended to avoid unfair results like this “glitch.” They also contended that the statute’s reference to the Secretary prescribing regulations is imperative rather than merely permissive, insisting that this language obligates the Secretary to set forth rules on how to handle newly available information on income changes.
