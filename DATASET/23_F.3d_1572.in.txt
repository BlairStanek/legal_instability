You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


D. Walters sought federal disability benefits and was initially denied by an administrative law judge. After the agency’s appeal body denied further review, D. Walters turned to the district court. That court produced a written order overturning and sending back the case to the agency, citing insufficient support for the original denial decision.

 On returning to the agency, additional proceedings took place. The Secretary ultimately granted benefits to D. Walters. After receiving a favorable outcome, D. Walters submitted a request in the district court for fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). The Secretary formally opposed that request, pointing to timing requirements.

 The dispute over the fee request proceeded before a magistrate judge, who denied D. Walters’s application. D. Walters then challenged that denial in the district court, which agreed with the denial on the basis that the application had not been submitted within the allowable period. D. Walters maintained that the application was timely based on when the agency handed down its final decision.

 In support of D. Walters’s position that fees should be approved, key arguments relied on the text of the EAJA, which speaks of submitting an application “within thirty days of final judgment in the action.” D. Walters’s side highlighted decisions like Melkonyan v. Sullivan, Shalala v. Schaefer, and Sullivan v. Hudson regarding the meaning of “final judgment” in the context of remands for further administrative proceedings. This side also stressed that the EAJA’s purpose is to remove the financial disincentive when citizens challenge governmental decisions they view as unjustified. According to these arguments, if the timeline were read strictly to begin before the agency finished its work, many deserving claimants would be blocked from any fee recovery. D. Walters’s position further noted that the relevant statutory language allows for judicial consideration of all effects of an ordered remand, so that a final decision in the case should be deemed to occur only after the agency’s subsequent actions are complete.

 The Secretary’s strongest arguments included the view that once the district court officially reversed and sent the matter back, the judgment there became “final” under the plain language of cases such as Melkonyan v. Sullivan and Shalala v. Schaefer, triggering the EAJA’s filing window. These arguments emphasized that the fee application deadline is grounded in statutory text that must be enforced without expansion, in keeping with the principle that waivers of sovereign immunity must be construed strictly. According to the Secretary, the filing requirement was missed if it was not met within thirty days after the district court entered its formal judgment sending the issue back, and no further administrative steps can postpone this obligation. By these arguments, awarding fees despite a missed deadline falls outside the expressly limited conditions of the statute and contravenes the American Rule, which holds that, absent explicit authorization, each side must bear its own legal costs.
