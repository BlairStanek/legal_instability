You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alex Price and Parker Davis became involved in a legal dispute after Parker Davis and Taylor Kim, who was Davis’s romantic partner at the time, were stopped by law enforcement while traveling in a 1977 Oldsmobile. A search revealed a scale in a duffel bag that held belongings of both individuals, and officers also discovered ten small packets containing a substance identified as cocaine in Taylor Kim’s purse. Although the title to the car showed that both Taylor Kim and Parker Davis once shared ownership, Davis had signed over his interest to Kim. Both had driver’s licenses listing the same current address and the same prior address. Eventually, Taylor Kim pled guilty to possessing cocaine under a plea agreement. Parker Davis was charged and received a lengthy prison sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to deliver and for having multiple prior felony convictions. After these proceedings, he pursued state appellate remedies, which ended with no further review granted by the state supreme court. He then filed a federal habeas corpus petition.

 Soon after their initial arrests, Parker Davis and Taylor Kim jointly retained Dylan Johnson to represent them. At a preliminary stage, Johnson argued that they had antagonistic defenses, which drew the prosecutor’s request to disqualify Johnson from representing Kim. The local trial court first allowed Johnson to continue, but kept open the question of disqualification. Eventually, once each case was bound over for trial, the court revisited the issue at the prosecutor’s request and concluded Johnson should not represent either individual. The court raised concerns that one client’s confidences might be used to the other’s advantage and that their defenses would likely remain irreconcilable. Taylor Kim later pled guilty, while Parker Davis requested a new attorney at public expense because he lacked the means to hire a replacement. By the time trial started, Parker Davis had married Taylor Kim, and Kim had already entered her guilty plea (although she had not yet been sentenced). Parker Davis repeatedly sought to have Dylan Johnson represent him, but the request was refused.

 During Parker Davis’s trial, the local trial court had granted a motion barring references to his earlier offenses. Nevertheless, at one point when Davis testified to having used drugs in the past but denied selling them, the prosecutor asked him about a prior marijuana conviction. Defense counsel objected immediately and moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. Instead, a curative instruction was given, directing the jury to disregard any prior offenses and decide the case solely on the evidence presented. Davis maintained that the evidence pointing to his guilt was not overwhelming—he contended that the nearby presence of cocaine in Taylor Kim’s purse, coupled with the couple’s shared living arrangements, confused the question of whose drugs were actually found. He insisted that the mention of his earlier marijuana offense unfairly prejudiced the jury. Arguments then arose over whether this reference impacted the fairness of the trial.

 Alex Price advances the position that disqualifying Dylan Johnson served a proper interest in avoiding potential conflicts of interest under principles articulated in Wheat v. United States. On that view, courts have considerable discretion to ensure that attorneys do not face ethically compromising positions and that trials proceed without the risk of divided loyalties. There is an emphasis on a court’s duty to protect the integrity of proceedings whenever defendants previously shared the same lawyer or might rely on one lawyer for interlocking defenses. Alex Price also contends that a passing reference to Parker Davis’s earlier marijuana-related legal trouble did not create a constitutional violation, particularly when the trial court swiftly issued an instruction to the jury forbidding them from considering any prior offense. Citing cases that recognize a strong curative instruction can mitigate prejudice, Alex Price maintains that the prosecutor’s single question about the earlier conviction does not inevitably deprive a defendant of a fundamentally fair trial.

 Parker Davis’s arguments center on an alleged infringement of the Sixth Amendment right to be represented by counsel of one’s choosing, referencing authorities such as Powell v. Alabama and related doctrines. According to Davis, he and Taylor Kim were willing to proceed with the same attorney, and any potential conflict of interest—particularly after Kim entered her guilty plea—could have been knowingly waived. Davis notes that courts customarily permit informed waivers, believing that joint representation may sometimes benefit defendants who share a united strategy. Davis also asserts that the prosecutor’s mention of a prior drug conviction, after the local trial court’s clear ruling against such disclosures, unjustly tipped the balance in the jury’s mind about his character and propensity. He contends that this improper query was especially damaging given the evidence was allegedly ambiguous concerning who really controlled the illegal substance. By focusing on Linton v. Perini and similar precedents, Davis underscores that any unwarranted intrusion into a defendant’s counsel choice, combined with the possibility of prejudicial spillover from prior drug arrests, implicates fundamental fairness principles that these doctrines safeguard.
