You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In 1990, Jordan R. Michaels, who was employed by Metro Physicians Insurance Division, participated in a group health plan governed by ERISA. Oak Health Coverage provided medical insurance for employees under that plan; the plan did not include routine dental coverage. Around that time, Michaels was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, and a surgical procedure was recommended by his oral and maxillofacial specialist, Dr. Simon Lake.

 Because the recommended procedure would involve repositioning Michaels’s jaws to alleviate airflow obstruction, Dr. Lake referred Michaels to the orthodontist, Dr. Brent Monroe, to prepare his teeth and jaws for surgery. This preparation included the installation of arch wires and braces, making molds for a guiding splint, and aligning Michaels’s teeth to accommodate the surgery. After receiving braces, Michaels underwent the jaw surgery intended to address his sleep apnea.

 In correspondence before the surgery, both Dr. Lake and Dr. Monroe wrote to Oak Health Coverage, seeking confirmation on coverage for the proposed treatment. Oak Health Coverage sent materials indicating that the jaw surgery portion would be deemed medically necessary. Michaels’s initial orthodontic visit was covered. However, Oak Health Coverage refused to pay the main orthodontic fee, citing a dental exclusion in the plan, leading Michaels to file suit in an Alabama court. The matter came to the federal court system under ERISA.

 One side contends that the group health plan specifically excludes services related to the care or treatment of teeth, including orthodontic care, and that this language should be interpreted as plainly disallowing coverage for braces or other orthodontic procedures. It emphasizes that the plan grants discretionary authority to the insurer to interpret its own coverage policies, pointing to the principles outlined in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch and subsequent precedent such as Brown v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Alabama. This side also underscores that the plan’s language is sufficiently decisive, drawing on the notion that insurance agreements are meant to separate medical coverage from purely dental work. It further argues that a conflict of interest does not necessarily exist because being structured as a non-profit entity reduces any profit-driven motive to deny claims.

 The other side maintains that the plan’s language is ambiguous with respect to orthodontic treatment used to facilitate a medically necessary procedure. Pointing to wording throughout the plan that references coverage for certain appliances and medically necessary care, it emphasizes that the orthodontic measures were part of the overall treatment for Michaels’s obstructive sleep apnea, which was not solely a dental issue. The argument highlights that the insurer’s payment of the first orthodontic visit and the plan’s silence on excluding medically necessary orthodontic preparation created a justified expectation of coverage. Additionally, references to case law interpreting similar provisions under ERISA—where ambiguities are construed against the drafter—bolster this side’s stance that the coverage determination should be resolved in favor of the insured. Advocates further note that revised plan documents in later years included more explicit language regarding exclusions, suggesting that the earlier plan’s language was far from clear.
