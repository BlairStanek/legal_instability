You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jones worked as a criminal defense attorney in Greenwood City, Pine County, Michigan. Thomas, a lawyer, was employed by Jones’s firm until she was discharged. After the discharge, Thomas lodged assault accusations against Jones based on events occurring around the time she ceased working at the firm. A local court proceeding followed concerning that assault charge, which was ultimately resolved in Jones’s favor.

 Shortly after Thomas’s separation from the firm, officials of the Pine County Prosecutor’s Office learned of her allegations that Jones habitually possessed and used marijuana. Thomas submitted an affidavit describing these allegations, including statements that she had witnessed Jones smoking marijuana at his office and that she had purchased marijuana from him. Thomas’s statements did not specify precise dates, but placed them in a time period before she was discharged. When officials initially sought authorization from certain judges of the district court to conduct a search of Jones’s office, apartment, and vehicle, those judges declined to grant the requested warrant.

 Later, a magistrate of the district court considered a renewed application for a warrant, supported by affidavits prepared with information from Thomas and an officer identified here as Bell. The magistrate issued a warrant authorizing a search of Jones’s residence and office for marijuana and related substances or evidence. During the subsequent search by law enforcement, they reported uncovering small amounts of suspected marijuana material. Laboratory analysis concluded that the seized materials totaled approximately 1.6 grams of marijuana. A federal grand jury later indicted Jones under 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) for the offense of marijuana possession.

 In favor of Jones, it is argued that the warrant application did not furnish a sufficient basis to demonstrate probable cause, emphasizing that Thomas’s credibility was questionable and unsupported by evidence of reliability. These arguments assert that her statements lacked the “veracity” and “reliability” safeguards described in precedent such as Illinois v. Gates, Spinelli v. United States, and Aguilar v. Texas. It is further contended that there was no independent police investigation corroborating Thomas’s claims, that her possible personal motives undermined her testimony, and that the information submitted was stale because she had not been near Jones’s office or apartment for some time. Finally, regarding any evidence obtained, Jones’s arguments maintain that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in United States v. Leon should not apply, on grounds that no objectively reasonable officer would have relied on a warrant so lacking in indicia of probable cause.

 In favor of the United States, it is argued that Thomas’s allegations possessed inherent credibility because she professed regular contact with Jones over a lengthy period, and she openly conceded her own marijuana use with him. Proponents of the warrant point to cases like United States v. Harris, asserting that admissions against one’s own penal interest carry intrinsic reliability. They further note that multiple searches of Jones’s premises in past years had uncovered marijuana, and that this background supported Thomas’s account of continuous drug activity. Additionally, it is argued that her personal appearance before the issuing magistrate allowed for firsthand evaluation of her demeanor, and that any concerns about her bias or motive could be weighed directly. Under these arguments, even if the question of probable cause was close, the officer’s reliance on the magistrate’s determination would still invoke the good faith exception recognized by United States v. Leon.
