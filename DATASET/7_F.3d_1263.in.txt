You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan served as Chief of Police in the city of Seaview. A state grand jury indicted Morgan on charges that included extortion, perjury, obstructing official business, and interfering with civil rights. These charges arose from alleged threats to local fire inspectors who planned to cite a bingo parlor, operated by Morgan’s daughter, for code violations. According to the prosecution’s theory, a detective named Lewis conveyed threats to two fire inspectors, Smith and Johnson, supposedly on Morgan’s behalf. After learning of Lewis’s alleged statements, the inspectors alerted their supervising officials, prompting further investigation.

 Prior to Morgan’s case, Lewis was tried separately and convicted of tampering with evidence, but later pardoned by Governor Stone. In Morgan’s trial, the prosecution planned to introduce a tape-recorded conversation between Lewis and one inspector. The prosecution anticipated objections to the tape, repeatedly requesting Morgan to raise any evidentiary challenges before trial so the prosecution could appeal immediately if needed. Morgan did not file such pretrial motions. During the trial itself, when the prosecution attempted to introduce the contested conversation, Morgan objected on hearsay grounds. The trial judge sustained the objection. The prosecution immediately filed a mid-trial appeal pursuant to a state procedural rule, aiming to challenge this evidentiary ruling.

 After the mid-trial appeal was filed, the judge directed the prosecution to proceed, but the prosecution insisted that proceeding was futile without the disputed evidence. The prosecution explicitly declined to rest but also refused to present further evidence. Morgan moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the judge declined to grant, opting instead to dismiss the case for want of prosecution. The dismissal led to the discharge of the impaneled jury. The prosecution argued that, once the mid-trial appeal was taken, the trial court lost jurisdiction. Morgan maintained that the dismissal ended the case, raising concerns about whether a new trial could be pursued. Disagreement arose over whether the trial court acted properly in dismissing the case and discharging the jury once the prosecution lodged its appeal.

 In support of Morgan returning to court to prevent retrial, advocates cite the Double Jeopardy Clause, emphasizing that jeopardy attaches once a jury has been sworn. They argue that terminating proceedings prematurely, or releasing the jury after key rulings, can bar another trial. They invoke United States v. Scott for the proposition that if a criminal proceeding is discontinued without the defendant’s request for a mistrial on grounds unrelated to factual guilt, further prosecution may be prohibited. They also suggest that since Morgan did not actively seek dismissal, and had merely raised a routine evidentiary objection, fundamental protections inherent in the Double Jeopardy Clause should prevent any additional prosecution. According to this view, once the first jury was discharged by the court, Morgan’s right to have that jury decide his innocence or guilt was irreversibly compromised.

 In support of the trial court’s authority to continue prosecuting Morgan, advocates point to state procedural rules permitting the prosecution to seek immediate review of rulings that significantly weaken its case. They rely on the logic that a mid-trial appeal is allowed where critical evidence is suppressed, citing both state procedure and precedents interpreting such rules in a manner that supports prosecution appeals without waiting for a final judgment. They contend that once the prosecution filed its mid-trial appeal, the trial court had no power to dismiss or discharge the jury because the trial proceedings were effectively suspended pending the appellate court’s decision. Further, they assert that if the trial court erroneously dismissed the jury, such action should be deemed void, and proceedings should resume before the same or another jury, given the paramount interest in allowing the prosecution to continue its case once the evidentiary ruling is reviewed.
