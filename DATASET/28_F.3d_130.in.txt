You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


The Randolph-Sheppard Act aims to provide individuals with visual impairments an opportunity to operate vending facilities on federal property. Under the Act, each state designates a state licensing agency to administer the program. The District of Columbia serves in that role for its jurisdiction. The Group of Vision-Impaired Shop Operators consists of licensees who allege the District of Columbia mishandled its responsibilities as the licensing agency. This group filed a grievance challenging multiple aspects of the District of Columbia’s administration of the program, including alleged failures by various subdivisions responsible for oversight and support.

 Initially, the Group of Vision-Impaired Shop Operators pursued an evidentiary hearing before a local office that the District of Columbia had tasked with hearing administrative complaints. While their grievance was pending, another lawsuit raised questions about whether that office could provide an effective remedy, and whether any rules existed that had been properly adopted for carrying out these hearings. Because those proceedings cast doubt on the possibility of obtaining enforceable relief, the Group sought to move on to arbitration through federal authorities. The federal agency then responsible for convening arbitration panels explained that such arbitration would only occur after a state-level hearing. The Group believed no effective hearing process existed, so they turned to the district court instead.

 Approximately two years passed from the time the Group of Vision-Impaired Shop Operators first filed their administrative grievance until they filed suit in the district court. During that period, they obtained an indefinite continuance of the local office’s hearing and were informed by federal authorities that arbitration was unavailable without the conclusion of that hearing. After the lawsuit began, the District of Columbia published new regulations intended to address prior deficiencies. By the time of trial, the regulations had been finalized for about a year. Even so, the Group proceeded in the district court, maintaining it would have been futile to await a hearing that the District had not made available when they first sought relief.

 In support of the District of Columbia’s position, it is argued that the Randolph-Sheppard Act expressly sets forth a detailed administrative grievance procedure and that individuals must first request a full evidentiary hearing before the designated state licensing agency. If dissatisfied, they must then seek arbitration through the Secretary who convenes a panel under the Act. Proponents of this view suggest that these steps guarantee the agency an opportunity to employ its expertise, resolve disputes internally, and create a clear record for possible judicial review. They point to the language of the Act, emphasizing that it contemplates an exhaustion of administrative remedies before federal litigation. They also invoke precedents underscoring the importance of following statutorily prescribed dispute-resolution schemes to prevent courts from bypassing an agency’s specialized role in correcting any errors.

 On the other side, the Group of Vision-Impaired Shop Operators contends that multiple delays and a lack of duly adopted rules meant there was no genuine administrative remedy to pursue, so beginning or completing the administrative process was impractical. They highlight prior judicial determinations suggesting that the forum to hear their complaints did not have validly issued regulations or clear jurisdiction, making any administrative hearing an empty formality. According to this argument, the text of the Act does not demand that licensees wait indefinitely for the state licensing agency to create and implement procedures that were long overdue. Citing caselaw on how courts may excuse exhaustion when the prescribed steps are plainly unavailable, they reason that their recourse to the district court was reasonable and within established legal exceptions to administrative prerequisites.
