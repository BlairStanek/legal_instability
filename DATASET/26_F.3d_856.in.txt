You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Amanda Brown is an individual who has never held formal employment and who asserts that she has a combination of limited intellectual functioning and severe headaches. She was evaluated as having a verbal IQ score of 67. She reports that the headaches can last for extended periods, sometimes up to two weeks, and that during these episodes she is unable to perform typical household chores or other daily tasks. At other times, she acknowledges an ability to watch television, care for pets, and occasionally engage in recreational activities like fishing and latch hooking. Amanda Brown states that her only headache medication is over-the-counter aspirin and that no physician has ever prescribed stronger treatments.

 Two medical professionals conducted examinations of Amanda Brown. Those examinations did not yield specific clinical findings related to her headaches, and neither professional formed an opinion as to whether the headaches actually occurred or how intense they might be. Amanda Brown claims that these headaches, taken together with her low IQ, constitute a severe combination of impairments that limit her functional capacity. A vocational expert testified during the administrative hearing, responding to a hypothetical question in which it was assumed Amanda Brown’s account of her headaches was accurate.

 The Secretary reviewed Amanda Brown’s claim using established regulations. Part of the review process addressed whether her daily activities were actually inconsistent with having prolonged, debilitating headaches. According to the record, her household chores do involve cooking and cleaning, and she also takes care of her dogs, but she insists that none of that can be done when the headaches are at their worst. Another area of inquiry focused on whether the lack of medical documentation for the headaches, combined with the fact that her only medication is aspirin, undermines her position. The administrative reviewers also looked at whether Amanda Brown’s low IQ, in addition to her reported headaches, would meet the criteria under relevant regulations concerning intellectual functioning and additional physical or mental impairments.

 In favor of Amanda Brown’s position, the arguments highlight that her verbal IQ score of 67 falls within the range specified by a particular listing in the regulations, potentially qualifying her for benefits if there is also an additional work-related impairment. The arguments emphasize that multiple decisions, including Polaski v. Heckler, instruct that subjective complaints—especially regarding pain—cannot be discounted solely because they lack full medical corroboration. Supporters of Amanda Brown’s claim also stress that where vocational evidence indicates even moderate headaches might interfere with the ability to engage in basic work functions, this would satisfy any requirement that a claimant show an additional, significant impairment. Proponents rely on the approach in Cook v. Bowen and similar precedent, arguing that any impairment with more than a minimal effect on employability is crucial to determining eligibility under certain provisions of 20 C.F.R. Part 404, subpt. P, App. 1, § 12.05C.

 In favor of the Secretary’s position, the arguments emphasize that Amanda Brown has offered little or no objective medical proof establishing her headaches or documenting their severity. The Secretary points out that no physician has perceived the need to prescribe stronger medication or further testing, and that the daily activities Brown performs—such as caring for pets and doing household chores—suggest she retains functional capacity sufficient for some level of work. Proponents of this view stress that the requirement in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, subpt. P, App. 1, § 12.05C calls for a “physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant work-related limitation,” and insist that this standard demands something more substantial than occasional, minimally supported complaints of pain. They maintain that the regulatory phrase “significant work-related limitation of function” should not be watered down to merely “more than slight or minimal,” arguing that the plain text of the regulation imposes a higher threshold that Amanda Brown has failed to meet.
