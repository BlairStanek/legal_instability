You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Charles Gray, acting as the father of Daniel Gray, initiated a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 following the death of Daniel. Daniel Gray, who was fifteen years old, had been inside an unoccupied dwelling to take money and other items one evening. Officers from the Memphis Police Department arrived at the location after a neighbor alerted them. While Daniel Gray was running toward a fence behind the property, one of the officers identified himself and ordered him to halt. Daniel continued climbing the fence, and the officer discharged his weapon, striking Daniel, who passed away from the injury.

 Charles Gray maintained that the actions taken by the officer amounted to an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Tennessee had a statute that authorized the use of necessary force, including lethal force, to apprehend someone who fled after being notified of an arrest, and the Memphis Police Department followed internal guidelines that also permitted such force in certain felony situations. Charles Gray argued that these guidelines contributed to the events leading to Daniel’s death.

 The officer who fired the shot had been taught that lethal force was acceptable for preventing a suspected felon from fleeing, particularly in burglary cases. Charles Gray contended that Daniel Gray posed no immediate threat, given that he was unarmed and was attempting to escape rather than resist with force. The City of Memphis, for its part, asserted that the officer relied on the then-existing teachings, which were seen as permissible under prevailing interpretations of the law.

 Charles Gray’s legal arguments emphasized that the Fourth Amendment protects against excessive uses of force, insisting that lethal force is unreasonable when officials lack a clear and objective basis to deem the person dangerous. He referred to case law suggesting that seizing a fleeing suspect with deadly force violates constitutional standards absent specific threats posed by the suspect. Charles Gray further contended that a municipal policy enabling deadly force against nonviolent, unarmed individuals should be seen as a direct cause of the loss he suffered. In his view, Monell v. Department of Social Services supports holding a municipality accountable when a policy or practice under its authority leads to constitutional infractions, particularly when the policy explicitly endorses lethal measures in nonviolent contexts.

 The City of Memphis countered that its policy was rooted in the longstanding Tennessee statute, which expressly legalized the use of lethal force to apprehend a fleeing felon under certain conditions. The City maintained that it had a reasonable basis to believe officers were acting in good faith compliance with the law. Moreover, the City argued that under Monell v. Department of Social Services, it should not be held liable unless it deliberately implemented a policy it knew would constitute an unconstitutional use of force, an element the City believed was absent because the relevant statute had not been invalidated at the time. Additionally, the City maintained that any changes it made to limit the use of force beyond what the statute allowed could not, in and of themselves, create liability if the officer’s actions still fell within the broader scope of state-sanctioned legal authority.
