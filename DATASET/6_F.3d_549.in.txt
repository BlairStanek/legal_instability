You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On a winter day in 1986, Alice Perry was involved in an automobile accident with a car driven by sixteen-year-old Kimberly Norris. Alice Perry held an underinsured motorist policy through Harborview Insurance, while Kimberly Norris was insured by Safeville Assurance. Following the accident, several rounds of settlement proposals were discussed between representatives of Safeville Assurance and Alice Perry (initially negotiating on her own and later through counsel). Offers and demands varied greatly, at times involving figures as low as twelve thousand dollars and as high as one hundred ten thousand dollars. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed, and counsel appointed by Safeville Assurance represented Kimberly Norris in the proceedings.

 Because Kimberly Norris was a minor, communications frequently involved her father, George Norris. At one point, George Norris was told that a verdict beyond the policy limits was possible, and he was advised to consider engaging a personal attorney. A private lawyer was indeed hired to look out for Kimberly Norris’s separate interests. On the final day before trial, George Norris was informed that there was a settlement demand within the policy limits, but there remains a question about whether he fully and unequivocally agreed or disagreed with Safeville Assurance’s decision not to pay the demanded amount.

 The subsequent trial resulted in a verdict that significantly exceeded Kimberly Norris’s policy limits with Safeville Assurance, triggering Harborview Insurance’s underinsured motorist obligation to Alice Perry. Afterward, Harborview Insurance received an assignment of any potential bad faith claim that Kimberly Norris might have had against Safeville Assurance. In that assigned claim, some asserted that George Norris was not provided sufficient information to give meaningful input on settlement decisions, while others maintained that he was adequately informed but still agreed to the approach taken. Additionally, there was debate about the nature and extent of Alice Perry’s injuries. Her primary physician declared her fully disabled and unable to pursue her former occupation, whereas another medical expert found that while she did suffer a soft tissue injury, it might not preclude her from all work, albeit with possible ongoing pain. Safeville Assurance did not conduct its own medical evaluation to dispute or verify these conclusions.

 In arguing that Harborview Insurance should prevail, it is contended that no reasonable basis existed for denying the settlement demand within policy limits, especially when Alice Perry’s injuries were substantiated through clear medical records and an acknowledged permanent impairment. Key precedents and doctrines emphasize that an insurer’s failure to investigate, fairly value, and respond to a legitimate claim can indicate bad faith. Proponents of this position note the insurer cannot rely on a “fairly debatable” argument if it has disregarded essential facts establishing the severity of the insured’s liability exposure and the permanency of the plaintiff’s injuries. According to this view, Safeville Assurance never properly assessed the claim or sought a thorough medical opinion, and it even cautioned Kimberly Norris’s family about a potential excess verdict. These advocates assert that once liability and serious injuries were established, the responsibility to engage in settlement negotiations more earnestly was clear.

 In arguing that Safeville Assurance should prevail, it is contended that the claim against Kimberly Norris remained fairly debatable and that Safeville Assurance sensibly exercised its right to test the plaintiff’s evidence in court. Referencing decisions in which courts have deemed disputes over injury valuations to be legitimate grounds for declining settlement within demanded amounts, Safeville Assurance maintains that conflicting medical opinions about Alice Perry’s ability to work cast real doubt on the magnitude of her damages. Supporters of this position also assert that George Norris, despite being a layperson, was kept generally informed of offers, demands, and the potential range of damages. Thus, they argue, if George Norris, after being apprised of these developments, consented to continue the defense rather than settle, such consent would cut off any later bad faith claim. The argument here is that an insured who knowingly chooses to risk trial cannot later complain of the very result that arose from that choice.
