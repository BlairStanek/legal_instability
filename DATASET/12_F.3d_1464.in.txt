You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In approximately 1986, Adan and Nina Ortega sought to assume a gas station and convenience store franchise from Jordan Neal. They agreed on a price that combined payment for the franchise rights and for existing inventory. Under the franchise agreements, Henley Supply Corp. had to approve any new franchisees, and the Ortegas successfully completed a dealer training program even though concerns arose about their accounting skills. When the deal closed, a representative of Henley Supply Corp., Morgan Webb, mentioned the possibility that the company might open a competing station nearby. The Ortegas were offered an opportunity to withdraw from the transaction but proceeded anyway.

 Over the next several months, Henley Supply Corp. repeatedly informed the Ortegas that their bookkeeping did not meet the required standards of the franchise agreement. Various notices were sent, audits were conducted, and the Ortegas were warned about potential non-renewal if the bookkeeping was not corrected. The Ortegas also allowed mandatory insurance to lapse and stopped restocking merchandise, while family members continued to operate the convenience store. Eventually, they were advised that their franchise would not be renewed upon its expiration. Shortly after, the Ortegas attempted to transfer their interest to a prospective buyer named Dylan Rivera, but tensions arose over whether that transfer would extend beyond the franchise’s remaining term.

 The Ortegas initiated legal action, claiming fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, violation of the California Franchise Investment Law, violation of the Unruh Act, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and multiple forms of interference with economic advantage. They contended that the franchise was withheld or threatened with non-renewal for improper reasons, including alleged racial bias. On the other side, Henley Supply Corp. pointed to the Ortegas’ inadequate bookkeeping, unanswered warnings, lack of required insurance, and discontinued stocking of the store as key concerns under the agreements.

 One line of argument advanced on behalf of Henley Supply Corp. relies on the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, which permits non-renewal if the franchisee does not comply with reasonable and materially significant terms, including maintaining proper records. The claim emphasizes that consistent bookkeeping was an explicit requirement and that the Ortegas repeatedly failed to rectify this issue despite receiving notices. The arguments also invoke the franchisor’s right to protect its interests under recognized legal principles, explaining that it remained within its rights to insist on accurate records and adequate insurance. Further, with regard to the attempted sale to Dylan Rivera, Henley Supply Corp. contends that requiring acknowledgment of a soon-to-expire franchise was legitimate under general rules allowing a party to protect its legally recognized economic interests. Regarding other state-law theories, the argument maintains that no fiduciary or special disclosure obligations attached to Henley Supply Corp. under the California Franchise Investment Law because it did not itself sell the franchise, but merely approved the transfer. Henley Supply Corp. also invokes the notion that any recommendation or paperwork requirement aimed at ensuring clarity about the franchise’s duration was a lawful assertion of contractual and statutory rights.

 In contrast, another line of argument emphasizes that the Ortegas’ franchise rights were not renewed for impermissible reasons such as animus tied to racial or ethnic background. Supporters of this position point to evidence that certain Henley Supply Corp. representatives allegedly urged the Ortegas to replace employees of particular backgrounds, and they suggest that those remarks demonstrate discriminatory motives. They argue that laws such as the Unruh Act, which prohibits discrimination in business dealings, and the broader intent of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to protect franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory treatment were undermined by the franchisor’s conduct. Additionally, these arguments characterize the Ortegas’ bookkeeping breaches or lapsed insurance as insufficient to justify the refusal to renew, or as pretextual devices used to mask a discriminatory purpose. They further maintain that, during the negotiations before the purchase, the Ortegas should have been fully informed about all relevant risks and prior bookkeeping issues, emphasizing that any omissions or misleading comments could amount to fraud or misrepresentation if key information about the station’s condition and prospects was withheld. Finally, this perspective insists that whether bias affected the decision is a factual question requiring a careful examination of motive, including whether racial comments or unfair treatment influenced or substantially contributed to the non-renewal and related franchise disputes.
