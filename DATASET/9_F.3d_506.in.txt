You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Officers from the Parkdale Police Department were dispatched to a residence at 22 East Maple Avenue in response to a neighbor’s call that a break-in might be in progress. The neighbor, Taylor Parker, had contacted the Parkdale Police Department after observing individuals entering through a broken window. When officers arrived, they saw that the doors were locked and that a windowpane was shattered. Four individuals were eventually found inside, including Morgan Reed, who stated she lived there with Casey Brown, the registered homeowner, but was not carrying any personal identification.

 The officers initially encountered Morgan Reed and another individual inside the home, then later discovered two additional people in the house. Morgan Reed explained that some of those present were her friends, that at least one friend had drugs in the home, and that they grew anxious when the police arrived. The officers noted that Morgan Reed did not have a key to open the door and claimed that she had only mail addressed to a “Ms. Reed” as proof she resided there. Meanwhile, Taylor Parker, the neighbor, stated to at least one officer that Morgan Reed was a legitimate occupant of the house and that Casey Brown was at work at Transway Shipping. The officers nevertheless detained the individuals, fearing a burglary could be underway.

 Once inside the home, the officers noticed items in plain view that raised concerns about potential explosives. These included ammunition, gun clips, fuses resembling a dynamite wick, piping with end caps, and books detailing ways to construct explosive devices. A locked case carried a warning sign indicating it contained black powder that could explode if moved. Disturbed by these items, the officers called in the Parkdale Fire Department bomb squad and, soon after, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The bomb squad lieutenant and a federal agent entered the residence separately to evaluate whether the materials posed an immediate public threat. When Casey Brown arrived, he refused to allow a thorough search, prompting officials to seek a warrant. Upon executing the warrant, the authorities seized a piece of PVC pipe with duct tape over one end, which subsequent testing showed to be a silencer. Casey Brown later faced charges under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) and § 5871, and 26 U.S.C. § 5861(i) and § 5871.

 Those supporting Alex Carter emphasize that officers have a critical obligation to investigate reports of possible felonies in progress promptly, referencing decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment and employing community caretaking functions. They argue that the presence of a shattered window and uncertain explanations about who lived in the home supplied probable cause to suspect a break-in. They also contend that the discovery of material that could be made into explosives presented a potentially grave public safety hazard, thereby justifying immediate entry under recognized exigent-circumstances doctrines in precedent such as Payton v. New York. Further, they stress that the officers confined their exploration to areas where individuals might be hiding, and that seeking a warrant once the homeowner refused consent was in accordance with established guidelines under decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment and 26 U.S.C. provisions.

 Those supporting Cameron Henry contend that, under Welsh v. Wisconsin, a home enjoys the highest degree of Fourth Amendment protection, and caution that none of the traditional exigents—hot pursuit, ongoing fire, or imminent destruction of evidence—were truly present. They point out that Morgan Reed was dressed in sleepwear, had documentation addressed to her at that address, and that a neighbor named Taylor Parker attempted to confirm her residency. They claim the police created the very urgency they later invoked by failing to contact Casey Brown’s workplace or thoroughly verify Morgan Reed’s statements. They highlight that further warrantless entries by the bomb squad and federal agents exacerbated any intrusion, exceeding any initial justification premised on a mistaken burglary suspicion. Under this line of reasoning, the single fact that questionable objects were observed does not, by itself, suspend Fourth Amendment requirements, especially when those objects were found after the premise that a break-in was taking place had already crumbled.
