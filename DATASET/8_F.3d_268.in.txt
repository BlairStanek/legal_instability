You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Officers from the Manning Police Department, having received an anonymous tip about illicit drugs, conducted a warrantless check of a trash container at a local night club, named the Green Owl. They secured the owner’s permission to search those outdoor receptacles. Officer Thomas led the initial examination, with other officers arriving soon after. Devon Carter, who was in the vicinity, caught their attention by walking briskly and appearing nervous.

 Officer Fernandez, noticing Devon Carter’s behavior, performed a pat-down after Carter allegedly resisted keeping still. Officer Wilson joined in and claimed to see, peeking from an open aspirin box in Carter’s shirt pocket, items that appeared to be plastic bags holding a suspicious white substance. Suspecting these to be illegal narcotics, the officers seized them. The government, represented by Regina Brown, then charged Carter with possession with intent to distribute, invoking federal drug statutes.

 During trial, Carter sought to exclude the seized substance, arguing it was obtained in violation of constitutional protections against warrantless searches. The district court reviewed conflicting assertions regarding whether the alleged contraband was visible in open sight or concealed. The issue centered on whether sufficient grounds existed to invoke the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, and there was debate on whose role it was—judge or jury—to resolve the facts tied to admissibility.

 For Devon Carter, the position is that the warrantless nature of the search rendered the evidence inadmissible, bolstered by arguments grounded in the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that searches typically require prior judicial authorization. These arguments highlight the principle recognized in Terry v. State of Ohio, emphasizing a strict interpretation of when an officer may undertake a limited search for weapons and when that search can extend to seizing non-weapon contraband. Further support invokes the exclusionary rule, as illustrated in Mapp v. Ohio, to urge that illegally obtained evidence must be suppressed to deter improper police conduct. Under this view, the constitution demands that the judge alone make the threshold determination on whether the plain view doctrine truly applies, and any error in how that was handled undermines the reliability of the seized evidence.

 For Regina Brown, the central argument is that the discovery of the suspected narcotics in open view justified an immediate seizure without a warrant, finding support in legal precedents such as Harris v. United States and Texas v. Brown, which recognize the plain view doctrine. According to this view, the officers were lawfully present during their investigation, and seeing apparent contraband in Carter’s pocket authorized them to take the aspirin box. Because that box allegedly displayed its contents in a manner confirming probable cause, the officers acted within established Fourth Amendment exceptions. Under this reasoning, any question about the validity of that seizure or its admissibility could also be fairly presented to a fact-finder to assess the credibility of the officer’s testimony that the contraband was indeed visible without further intrusion.
