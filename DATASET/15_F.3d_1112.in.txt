You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. originally controlled an international flight route connecting Windville and Redtown. Facing severe financial difficulties, Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. pursued a major sale of certain transatlantic assets. Triangle Air Lines, Inc. proposed to purchase those transatlantic routes under a detailed asset purchase agreement, which also incorporated conditions about potential reorganization funding in the bankruptcy proceedings pending in the Southern District of New City. The agreement included a provision requiring approval from a federal agency for any route transfer.

 By the terms of their arrangement, Triangle Air Lines, Inc. agreed to pay a sum for several transatlantic routes, including Windville–Redtown. Under the same agreement, if the transfer was not approved by a certain deadline, either party could issue notice to terminate, subject to a short cure period in which the federal agency could still grant its approval. Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. then ceased its international and domestic air service altogether, prompting the federal agency to grant Triangle Air Lines, Inc. a temporary exemption to operate the Windville–Redtown route while awaiting a final decision.

 Meanwhile, Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. entered into a “backup” contract with Northern Way Airlines, Inc. to transfer the same Windville–Redtown certificate if the federal agency denied the transfer to Triangle Air Lines, Inc. Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. also asserted that Triangle Air Lines, Inc. had failed to fulfill contractual obligations to fund Latin American operations, raising claims of a material breach. With the deadline for the agency’s approval approaching, Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. sought both to terminate its agreement with Triangle Air Lines, Inc. and to withdraw the joint application to transfer the route. Triangle Air Lines, Inc. disputed Blue Skies Airlines, Inc.’s right to do so, asserting that Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. remained bound by their contract. Northern Way Airlines, Inc. stood ready to acquire the route if the federal agency rejected the transfer to Triangle Air Lines, Inc.

 Supporters of Triangle Air Lines, Inc. emphasize that the relevant statute, the Federal Aviation Act, allows a carrier to transfer an international route upon federal approval, provided the transaction is consistent with the public interest. They argue that once a carrier and a prospective transferee have jointly initiated the transfer process, the federal agency possesses the authority to decide on it. They contend that allowing a unilateral withdrawal after considerable administrative efforts would undermine public interest factors in efficiency and resource conservation. They also assert that it is appropriate to leave questions of contractual breaches to the bankruptcy court, and that Route 401(h) of the Federal Aviation Act does not explicitly give either party an unrestricted right to withdraw at any stage. In their view, nothing in the act prevents the agency from granting the certificate in a conditional manner—such as placing a reversionary interest in the original carrier if, ultimately, a court finds that the contract was invalid. As an additional point, they highlight that the agency can ensure that services to smaller markets, like Dartmouth, remain in place or are suitably replaced with alternative connections, fulfilling the public need for continuous and reliable service.

 Proponents of Blue Skies Airlines, Inc. counter that the plain language of the Federal Aviation Act makes clear that a route may not be transferred without the voluntary consent of the current holder of the certificate. According to this view, the statutory text and structure illustrate that the federal agency’s role is only to approve or disapprove a consensual transaction, not to impose one upon a carrier that has reneged on the original deal. They argue that the statute’s emphasis on market principles means carriers must remain free to withdraw an application and to sell the route to a different buyer if economic circumstances or contractual considerations change. They further contend that preserving private market choice promotes efficiency, ensuring the route is placed with the airline offering the best overall arrangement for the carrier and the traveling public. Finally, they maintain that requiring the carrier to complete a deal it purports to have lawfully terminated intrudes upon the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, which is entrusted to interpret and enforce contractual rights and obligations in a debtor’s reorganization or liquidation.
