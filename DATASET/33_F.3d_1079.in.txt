You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Morgan Watson, separated from her husband, lived in the Sunset trailer park with her two children, Daniel (age 10) and Hannah (age 2½). She worked late shifts at the Red Fox Tavern, finishing around or after midnight. Because Morgan Watson did not want to burden her own parents with Hannah, who could be difficult, she often turned to Jordan Cooper and his companion, Avery Walters, to help with babysitting. They also had a young child, Logan. Morgan Watson considered Jordan Cooper and Avery Walters close friends. During the summer, Hannah sometimes stayed overnight with them. According to Morgan Watson, Hannah never showed signs of abuse or mentioned any mistreatment at that time. However, on one occasion, Hannah told her mother that Jordan Cooper had put “medicine” on her, but Morgan Watson was unsure what her daughter meant. Eventually, Morgan Watson switched to a different daytime babysitter, Taylor Brooks, who later claimed that Hannah accused Jordan Cooper of hurting her.

 Taylor Brooks and her husband, Mr. Brooks, cared for multiple children in their home. In the past, Taylor Brooks had notified authorities regarding suspected child abuse on several occasions. One day, while Taylor Brooks was occupied with errands, Hannah reportedly said Jordan Cooper had put “medicine” in her and called him “a bad man.” Mr. Brooks prompted Hannah to explain further, and Hannah allegedly described digital assault in childish terms and said Jordan Cooper told her not to tell. Taylor Brooks reacted with revulsion but tried to question Hannah in what she considered a gentle, non-threatening manner. Taylor Brooks then involved the county’s Witness Support Office. Meanwhile, Hannah made conflicting statements, at one point denying Jordan Cooper had done anything wrong. Hannah was later taken by Morgan Watson and Ethan Ross from the Witness Support Office to the Child Welfare Center at Children’s Medical Center in Bayside, California, where Sydney Carter, a social worker, interviewed her. That interview was recorded on videotape. Afterward, Dr. Rebecca Grant, a physician at that facility, examined Hannah and found physical indications that she concluded could be consistent with multiple episodes of forced contact occurring within a certain window of time.

 The videotaped conversation between Hannah and Sydney Carter contained questions about body parts and alleged sexual acts. Sometimes Hannah answered directly, including references to Jordan Cooper’s behavior toward her. She occasionally used the same word—“medicine”—to describe different substances, leading to confusion over whether she might have meant a gel-like product, something else, or both. Hannah also made a statement that seemed to accuse her mother, Morgan Watson, of having sexual contact with Jordan Cooper in Hannah’s presence, but Morgan Watson denied this. There were further unresolved discrepancies in Hannah’s statements, including her references to pictures and her retraction regarding those pictures. Other inconsistencies arose when Hannah spoke of spilled “medicine” in a car, which Morgan Watson described as hair gel. Separately, there was testimony that Morgan Watson once had a sexual relationship with Jordan Cooper’s brother, Aaron, which she insisted Hannah never witnessed. The authorities relied significantly on the recorded interview and on Dr. Grant’s observations in forming the basis for indicting Jordan Cooper.

 In support of Jordan Cooper’s position, various arguments center on the reliability and admissibility of Hannah’s out-of-court statements. It is contended that any statements made by a young child in response to repeated questioning by multiple adults, including caretakers and investigators, should be subjected to a high standard of scrutiny under doctrine arising from Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. Citing cases such as Idaho v. Wright and Ohio v. Roberts, Jordan Cooper’s position is that hearsay evidence from a child must be tested for “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,” assessed independently of any corroborating evidence. Because Hannah’s statements may have referenced different “medicines” or were arguably influenced by prior conversations with caregivers, Jordan Cooper’s advocates point to potential misinterpretation, suggestion, and inconsistency. They maintain that without demonstrating a solid, established exception to the hearsay rule or strong indicators of inherent reliability, these statements do not meet constitutional standards for confrontation. The argument stresses that Hannah’s denial on one occasion and potentially fantastical claims—such as references to Jordan Cooper forcing Morgan Watson into a sexual act—raise legitimate doubts about the trustworthiness of the accusations under constitutional principles of fair trial and confrontation.

 In advocating for the state of Arizona, there is a contention that Hannah’s statements about what allegedly happened with Jordan Cooper are sufficiently reliable to be admitted under exceptions such as those recognizing circumstances where a young child discloses abuse in a setting focused on her well-being. Drawing on reasoning exemplified by certain discussions in Idaho v. Wright, the state suggests that spontaneous remarks and repeated explanations of the same alleged acts across separate contexts can indicate trustworthiness. The state further cites the child-protective interviews and the physical findings by Dr. Rebecca Grant, highlighting the medical opinion that Hannah’s injuries were consistent with repeated forced contact. It is argued that the context in which Hannah spoke—first to Taylor Brooks under informal circumstances, then to a social worker—supports the idea that she had limited incentive to fabricate. The state emphasizes that examining the totality of the situation reveals no apparent motive for Hannah to lie about harm. Instead, the state proposes that Hannah’s statements reflect content that a child her age would be unlikely to invent, suggesting a permissible inference of credibility. Under this view, the medical and contextual evidence together supply the reliability needed for the child’s out-of-court statements to be admissible without violating the Confrontation Clause.
