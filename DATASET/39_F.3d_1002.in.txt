You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A group of individuals associated with the Miller Salaried Retirees Action Committee took steps to organize and communicate with fellow participants in the Miller Non-Bargaining Retirement Program regarding certain concerns about how program assets might be used. These individuals requested from the Fowler Administrator a list of all names and addresses for others in the program so they could reach out and share information.

 The Miller Salaried Retirees Action Committee claimed that surplus funds existed in the Miller Non-Bargaining Retirement Program and that participants might have an interest in using these funds to improve retirement benefits. According to the committee, obtaining the list of participants was necessary to contact everyone about these possibilities. In response, the Fowler Administrator declined to turn over any such list.

 Litigation ensued under laws governing employee benefit plans, with the Miller Salaried Retirees Action Committee asserting that various disclosure requirements under these laws and the principles of trust administration compelled the Fowler Administrator to provide the requested information. By contrast, the Fowler Administrator maintained there was no obligation to release a roster of participant names and addresses. Both sides raised broader questions about the practical implications of circulating personal information, the scope of disclosure duties, and how these duties connect to protecting or enhancing retirement benefits.

 In arguing for disclosure of the list, the Miller Salaried Retirees Action Committee pointed to statutory provisions requiring administrators to act in the exclusive interest of participants. They stressed that common law trust principles often demand transparency, particularly when participants seek to determine whether their retirement program is administered with prudence and care. They also cited language in the statutes that compels administrators to furnish various program documents upon request, contending that a compilation of participant identities and addresses qualifies as one of the instruments needed for program operation. In this view, having the names and addresses of fellow participants is necessary for collective efforts to protect or improve benefits, and disclosure ensures that those charged with overseeing program assets remain accountable.

 On the other side, the Fowler Administrator emphasized that the applicable laws do not mandate provision of every category of information, especially if it does not directly inform participants about specific benefit calculations or plan finances. Referring to precedent that focuses on whether a request directly relates to the provision of benefits, the Fowler Administrator insisted that the list itself does not shed light on the program’s financial health or management. Moreover, there were concerns that privacy interests should be balanced against any claimed need for names and addresses, especially in a context where large numbers of individuals could be affected. From this perspective, a mailing list was characterized as distinct from core plan documents and not covered by explicit disclosure requirements, thereby reducing administratively burdensome demands on a retirement program and safeguarding participants’ personal information.
