You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In late 1992, The Government brought charges against Alex Johnson, alleging that he sold crack cocaine on multiple occasions to a confidential informant named Ethan Rivers. The Government contended that, on two separate instances in November of that year, Rivers purchased small amounts of crack from Johnson while wearing a body transmitter, with local law enforcement officials in Brookhaven, Ohio, monitoring the transactions. A further purchase was set up in December by Rivers, who claimed to have arranged with Johnson to buy a more substantial quantity of crack in the parking lot of a shuttered creamery.

 According to materials in the record, on December 3, 1992, after Rivers completed the third alleged purchase, local officers placed Johnson under arrest, searched him, and found additional crack, cash, a knife, and a pager. It was also reported that Johnson directed the officers to retrieve a sawed-off shotgun that he said he had used for protection in separate, earlier incidents. Following these events, a federal indictment was issued, eventually corrected, and Johnson pleaded not guilty. The case proceeded toward trial, with questions arising about how many days passed before the trial began.

 At sentencing, there was considerable discussion about the total amount of crack at issue and whether Johnson possessed some of it only for personal use, rather than for distribution. Additional facts appeared concerning Johnson’s health status—he was reportedly HIV positive—and how that might affect any prison term. There was also a detainer lodged by California officials, apparently tied to Johnson’s past voluntary manslaughter conviction in that state, prompting disputes over whether he was in custody solely awaiting trial. Both sides vigorously debated whether his physical condition and the possibility of divergent sentencing outcomes should be taken into consideration.

 In support of The Government’s position, reference was made to the Speedy Trial Act provisions under 18 U.S.C. § 3161 and § 3164, with assertions that the relevant statutory clock permitted bringing Johnson to trial beyond the ordinarily specified timeline if he was deemed to be in particular categories of custody. Emphasis was also placed on evidence that the additional quantity of drugs, the cash, and the presence of a sawed-off shotgun could demonstrate intent to distribute, pointing to contours of federal precedent allowing juries and courts to consider such items as indicative of broader drug-dealing activity. With regard to sentencing, The Government argued that guidelines established under the Sentencing Reform Act, as interpreted in cases such as Mistretta v. United States, provided a constitutionally sound framework and permitted courts to include all relevant drug amounts. The Government also pointed out that physical or health-related conditions must be “extraordinary” under U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4 to merit modifying the standard sentencing range.

 Johnson advanced a contrary set of arguments, maintaining that his trial did not begin within the seventy-day limit established by 18 U.S.C. § 3161, and that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3164 did not apply because of the detainer lodged against him for his parole violation from California. On evidentiary matters, he contended that the sawed-off shotgun had minimal probative value and was likely to create unfair prejudice in the jury’s mind. In calculating the quantity of drugs, Johnson denied that all the crack found on him was intended for distribution, claiming that some was for personal use and therefore should not enhance his sentence. As for his HIV-positive status, Johnson argued that the Sentencing Guidelines had not fully accounted for the comparatively shortened life expectancy and increased medical costs, thereby suggesting that a lower sentence would be appropriate. Finally, Johnson contended that any prohibition on downward departures for such factors risked violating constitutional protections by eliminating proportional sentencing considerations.
