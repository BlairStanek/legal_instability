You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In late January of 1993, Carter King departed Florida aboard a vessel registered to a foreign entity. A few days later, members of the Coast Guard, a government agency, boarded that vessel while it was anchored approximately 200 miles southeast of a renamed coastal city (previously “Miami”) and about 50 miles north of Cuba. A subsequent search revealed various firearms that were not registered, including explosives, machine guns, and automatic rifles with additional launch capabilities.

 After being taken into custody, Carter King acknowledged that the weapons were loaded onto the vessel in a renamed Florida location (previously “Marathon”) and intended for transit to Cuba. He explained that the purpose of this transport was in service of resistance activities in Cuba, although he denied revealing the identity of any additional organizers. Carter King was then indicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) for possession of unregistered firearms, and he pleaded guilty to that offense.

 At the sentencing stage in the district court, Carter King sought a reduced penalty on grounds that his conduct was aimed at a lesser harm under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.11, asserting that moving arms out of the United States did not create the domestic danger that the firearm-registration law was intended to prevent. He also argued that juries in Florida, in some past cases, had found similarly situated defendants not guilty based on sympathetic views of actions directed against an unpopular regime abroad. Meanwhile, the Government contended that the law addresses all unregistered firearm situations, regardless of the user’s personal motives, emphasizing that the inherent dangers associated with these weapons remain significant.

 According to positions supporting the Government’s side, statutes such as 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) and the broader National Firearms Act are designed to protect public safety by ensuring strict registration of certain classes of uniquely dangerous firearms. The Government’s arguments rely upon the legislative intent underlying the Act, which, as interpreted in decisions like Staples v. United States, focuses on preventing the use of powerful weapons in situations where lives could be lost or serious violence might occur. Additional references to cases such as United States v. Salemi and United States v. Godfrey reinforce the notion that even if the firearms are destined for use outside the United States, the legislature’s goal is to control these weapons at the source. The Government argues that preventing any risk of those weapons fomenting violence aligns with Congress’s deep concern about public safety and that there is no exception for subjective beliefs about potential foreign conflicts.

 From Carter King’s perspective, the arguments in favor of a departure hinge on the premise that the Sentencing Guidelines, under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.11, are not meant to penalize someone whose actions do not implicate the usual harms the statute seeks to prevent. Carter King cites the idea that, in circumstances akin to those recognized in cases like United States v. White Buffalo, if risky items are used for a purpose outside the typical violent context—in his situation, an asserted foreign political cause—this diminishes the societal concern that underlies registration laws. He also maintains that the unique political climate surrounding Cuba, along with shifting diplomatic stances, places his actions outside the usual scope of the firearms statute. Given that 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) does not specifically address situations in which weapons are rapidly leaving the country to support foreign endeavors, Carter King contends that a downward adjustment is both fair and appropriate.
