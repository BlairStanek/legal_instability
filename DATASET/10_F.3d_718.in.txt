You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In early January of a particular year, a judgment was entered by the district court that ended the primary dispute on the merits involving Jordan Mason and several other individuals. A few days later, the district court entered an amended judgment, this time including an award of costs to other parties but leaving the earlier ruling against Jordan Mason in place without awarding any costs against him. The amended judgment also stated that the deadline for any post-trial motions under Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would begin on the date the amended judgment was entered. Jordan Mason, relying on that statement, filed a motion for a new trial shortly thereafter.

 Various dates became important to both Jordan Mason and the Government. The original judgment was filed one day and officially entered the next, while the amended judgment was entered about a week later. Jordan Mason’s post-trial motion was submitted more than ten days after the original judgment was entered but fewer than ten days after the amended judgment. Jordan Mason stated that he believed the later date controlled his filing deadlines because the district court explicitly said so in the amended judgment.

 After Jordan Mason’s motion for a new trial was filed, the district court denied it later in the spring, stating that the motion was timely. From that denial, Jordan Mason filed a notice of appeal around two months later. The Government then raised questions about whether the first judgment or the amended judgment truly constituted the final judgment date for computing deadlines, and whether the post-trial motions were filed on time. Both the Government and Jordan Mason pointed to federal statutes, procedural rules, and precedent to argue about the importance of timely appeals, the meaning of final judgments, and the effect of a court’s assurance about post-trial deadlines.

 The arguments put forth for the Government emphasize longstanding rules that a court’s final ruling on the merits under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 is the critical event that triggers the time for appeals, regardless of whether costs remain to be awarded. Under Rule 58, the Government contends that a delay in awarding costs cannot postpone the finality of a judgment on the merits. The Government also cites decisions such as Catlin v. United States, Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., and Buchanan v. Stanships, Inc. to show that unresolved costs do not alter the finality date on which the time to appeal begins. Moreover, the Government relies on Rule 6(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which explicitly bars a district court from extending the period for filing a Rule 59(e) motion. According to the Government, even if a district court erroneously suggests a later date for filing, the strict deadlines in the federal rules control. The Government’s position is that a clear, mandatory timeline governs the validity of appeal notices, and any confusion or statements by a court cannot override the explicit provisions of the federal rules.

 The arguments in support of Jordan Mason center on the point that the district court unambiguously assured him—and all parties—that the ten-day period for filing post-trial motions under Rule 59 would start with the amended judgment. Jordan Mason points out that the district court restated this assurance when it denied the motion for a new trial, noting that his filing was made within what the district court viewed as the proper time. To bolster his position, Jordan Mason invokes the notion that if a party reasonably relies on a trial court’s statements or actions regarding deadlines, fairness dictates allowing the filing to be treated as timely. He refers to precedent suggesting that, when a court explicitly leads a party to believe a filing is valid under the rules, there may be “unique circumstances” that justify respecting that reliance. Jordan Mason argues that, had the court or the opposing side questioned the timing at the outset, he could have taken different steps to file his appeal earlier, and equity should protect a litigant who has simply followed the court’s guidance.
