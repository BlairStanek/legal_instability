You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Redwood Portraits is a company operating numerous portrait studios throughout the United States. It discovered that Valley Camera, a business engaged in developing skills, selling photographic supplies, and reproducing photos, had allegedly made copies of several photographs to which Redwood Portraits claimed a valid copyright. After realizing that Valley Camera might be reproducing photographs without permission, Redwood Portraits requested that Valley Camera cease all copying of Redwood Portraits’ portraits. Redwood Portraits then organized further investigation to examine whether such copying continued.

 Redwood Portraits arranged for a private investigator to take four photographs—registered by Redwood Portraits with the relevant federal office—to various retail outlets belonging to or affiliated with Valley Camera. These photographs were marked with a copyright notice. The investigator was able to secure reproductions from Valley Camera, at times signing a form stating that the person bringing in the photograph owned it and that Valley Camera would be held harmless if the photo in question turned out to be copyrighted. Additionally, Redwood Portraits had, in other instances, allowed copying by certain individuals who had purchased photographs, though the precise conditions of that permission were later disputed.

 Redwood Portraits initiated a civil action in the district court, asserting that Valley Camera had thereby infringed Redwood Portraits’ rights in the four photographs at issue. Redwood Portraits sought statutory damages, attorney’s fees, and also asked the district court to enjoin Valley Camera from further reproductions of Redwood Portraits’ copyrighted works, including potential future works not yet registered. Valley Camera responded that it had obtained explicit permission in each transaction from an individual representing themself as the owner of the physical photograph and that its hold-harmless agreement justified or shielded its conduct. Valley Camera further pointed to Redwood Portraits’ own instructions to the investigator, suggesting that the investigator’s readiness to have the photos copied constituted a valid authorization.

 In support of Redwood Portraits, the arguments rely on the principle that the Copyright Act, including 17 U.S.C. § 106, grants the owner the sole right to reproduce and license reproduction of the work. Redwood Portraits cites settled interpretations indicating that a copyright holder cannot be deemed to have authorized a copy merely because its investigator requested that copy under a ruse. Redwood Portraits underscores that registration is not a prerequisite for the scope of copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. § 408(a), though it is important for seeking certain statutory remedies. It also invokes 17 U.S.C. § 502(a), arguing that courts possess the broad power to enjoin future infringement, no matter the registration status of the asserted works. Redwood Portraits stresses that an agreement purporting to indemnify a reproducer is void if the reproducer knew or should have known the photographs were copyrighted. Redwood Portraits points to preceding decisions that refer to the possibility of permitting investigators to request copies in order to detect ongoing infringement, maintaining that this practice does not relieve the reproducer of liability or bestow consent to copy.

 In response, Valley Camera’s core position is that Redwood Portraits granted authority to the investigator to order the exact reproductions in question. By signing a document stating that the person requesting the copy assumed responsibility and released Valley Camera from liability, the investigator effectively waived Redwood Portraits’ exclusive rights. Valley Camera relies on the language in 17 U.S.C. § 106(1), pointing out that the investigator’s actions could have been understood as an exercise of “authorization” from the actual copyright holder if the detective was indeed acting on Redwood Portraits’ behalf. Valley Camera also references Redwood Portraits’ history of permitting certain reproductions by customers, claiming that such prior allowances undercut Redwood Portraits’ position that any copying was categorically unauthorized. Furthermore, Valley Camera argues that if Redwood Portraits’ own agent provided consent to copy, Redwood Portraits should not be able to later disavow that consent for purposes of seeking statutory damages or an injunction. Finally, Valley Camera asserts that the hold-harmless forms were legitimate business tools, providing a reasonable basis for believing that the requested reproductions were authorized by the rightful owner.
