You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Davis worked as a farm labor contractor in a portion of North County, Texas, sometimes referred to in the record as the River Plains. He regularly placed a large number of agricultural workers on various farms in that area. The Secretary asserted that those workers included individuals not authorized to work in the United States, prompting an official investigation into Jordan Davis’s hiring practices. Both parties focused on whether Jordan Davis had hired these individuals with knowledge of their unauthorized status.

 Witness accounts described how Jordan Davis’s workforce often had a very high turnover rate, sometimes reaching about sixty percent each day. Two witnesses testified that they were not authorized to work in the United States but were hired to work on sites connected with Jordan Davis’s operations. Certain documents, including forms used prior to deportation proceedings, named Jordan Davis as an employer for a number of individuals. Meanwhile, one liaison officer from a government employment commission visited Davis’s job sites and occasionally found unauthorized workers but also investigated and sometimes found that many of Davis’s workers appeared to be lawfully employed.

 Several statements were collected from individuals during deportation processing, and these statements also included references to working for Jordan Davis. Some of the documents introduced showed that hundreds of unauthorized individuals had allegedly indicated Jordan Davis as an employer, with a subset of those names appearing more than once. There was additional testimony that Jordan Davis did not have extensive formal education and relied heavily on minimal verification when hiring. In turn, the Secretary presented the position that Davis’s repeated association with unauthorized workers had a bearing on whether he knew of their unauthorized status.

 In support of Jordan Davis, key legal arguments invoked provisions of 29 U.S.C. § 1816, emphasizing that “with knowledge” reflects an element of subjective awareness rather than a mere failure to inspect certain documents. Arguments pointed to how 29 U.S.C. § 1816(b) creates a safe-harbor or affirmative defense but does not impose an absolute duty to check prescribed documents. Supporters of Davis underscored the large daily turnover of workers and the difficulty of controlling every aspect of the workforce in a region with significant movement of laborers. They contended that a few documented instances of unauthorized workers did not automatically show that Davis had actual knowledge of those individuals’ status. References were made to authorities interpreting statutory “knowledge” requirements as imposing a burden on enforcing agencies to prove actual, subjective awareness, or specific intent. Some arguments analogized to the structure found in acts like the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which was said to keep the burden of proving “knowing” conduct on the agency rather than on the employer to establish innocence.

 In support of the Secretary, key arguments held that 29 U.S.C. § 1816 permits the use of prescribed document checks to avoid potential violations and that, by not adequately verifying workers’ status through the full set of approved methods, a farm labor contractor risks employing unauthorized workers with knowledge. The Secretary’s position maintained that where substantial numbers of unauthorized individuals surfaced repeatedly, a factfinder could infer a contractor had knowledge or purposefully avoided discovering the truth. Supporting citations focused on how regulatory schemes generally allow adverse inferences when an employer consistently interacts with workers in regions known for widespread unauthorized labor yet fails to follow available document-verification procedures. The Secretary pointed to cases holding that “willful ignorance” may equate to knowing employment of unauthorized workers, suggesting that repeated identification of unauthorized employees, coupled with the contractor’s limited verification steps, could lead to a conclusion of knowledge. These arguments also looked to the broader structure of labor-protection laws, emphasizing that even though an affirmative duty may not be explicitly stated, ignoring evidence of unauthorized labor is not permissible.
