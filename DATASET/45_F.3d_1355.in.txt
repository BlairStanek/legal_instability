You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Alex Carter was tried in Oregon for various offenses involving an underage individual. He had been previously involved in a separate matter several years earlier, which featured a similar method of approaching a minor. During the more recent incident, Carter is said to have attempted to persuade an underage individual to get into his vehicle by claiming he needed help finding a missing dog. The individual did not comply, and the encounter led to criminal charges against Carter. Evidence from Carter’s older case, which involved another thirteen-year-old, was introduced at trial.

 In both the older case and the more recent one, Carter allegedly employed the same story regarding a missing dog. In the older case, it was claimed that Carter had kidnapped and assaulted the minor. During the later proceeding, the prosecution introduced these alleged similarities to demonstrate Carter’s mindset, particularly his intent. The court provided instructions limiting how the jury could use the earlier incident. Carter argued that this was unfairly prejudicial, asserting that the earlier episode did not necessarily prove his intentions at the time of the more recent incident.

 Besides challenging the introduction of the older case, Carter also questioned whether the evidence was enough to prove he made a substantial step toward the charged offenses. He contended that trying to speak with the underage individual and asking for help, even if suspicious, did not rise above preparation. Furthermore, Carter claimed that he was improperly subjected to a dangerous offender sentence under Oregon law. He argued that certain requirements in that law were effectively altered—assigning the determination of dangerousness to the jury rather than the judge—and that such changes violated equal protection principles and the ex post facto clause. The State maintained that the court applied existing Oregon decisions correctly and that Carter’s past offenses supported the conclusion regarding his dangerousness.

 In support of its case, the State emphasizes that Oregon Evidence Rule 404(3) and Oregon Evidence Rule 403 (as well as counterparts in federal law) permit the introduction of prior acts to show intent or a plan. The State underscores that Carter’s consistent use of the same alleged tactic, even after many years in custody, is probative of his purpose for approaching this underage individual. Citing various precedents, the State contends that Oregon law defines an attempt broadly, focusing on whether the defendant’s conduct significantly corroborates a criminal aim. The State further insists that Oregon’s sentencing scheme, including the dangerous offender provisions, is not newly created but has stood in substantially the same form. Thus, according to the State, Carter had clear notice that his prior conduct could bear on any future sentencing determination.

 On the other hand, Carter’s arguments emphasize that the older episode involved different specific acts and that pointing to it did not firmly establish his purpose this time. He asserts that mere words or attempts to speak with someone, even if ill-intentioned, do not necessarily meet the threshold of a substantial step under statutes such as Or. Rev. Stat. § 161.405(1). He stresses that a showing of mere similarity in approach is too speculative to confirm intent to carry out the charged offenses. Carter also contends that the approach taken by the court in imposing a dangerous offender sentence was a retroactive alteration of Oregon’s law, triggering constitutional concerns under the ex post facto clause and raising equal protection issues by changing the fact-finder’s identity from the judge to the jury. He asserts that, by leaving the ultimate determination to the jury instead of strictly following the preexisting statutory procedure, the court expanded what was possible regarding his sentencing, contravening his constitutional safeguards.
