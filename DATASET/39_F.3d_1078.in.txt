You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A dispute arose when Local Collective #6 obtained a monetary judgment against Mr. Jackson after prior legal proceedings. That money judgment totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars, plus accumulated interest. Mr. Jackson had pension benefits paid out from a private pension plan, and Local Collective #6 attempted to collect on its judgment by garnishing funds that had been or would be distributed to Mr. Jackson. At one point, Mr. Jackson’s pension benefits, which were part of a recurring retirement payment, had either been deposited into a specific account or were being sent to him at his home in Texas. Local Collective #6 sought to use garnishment to collect from these distributions.

 Mr. Jackson objected to the garnishment in both the district court in Colorado and in another district court in Texas, raising questions as to whether any federal law prevented the garnishment of these pension distributions. While those challenges were pending, the parties arranged several stipulations so that all disputed pension benefits—both those already paid to Mr. Jackson and those due in the future—would be routed into a single account in Abbeyville, Colorado. With all funds brought under one location, the legal contest over whether garnishment could lawfully reach those sums was consolidated into a single proceeding.

 In that proceeding, the district court considered whether federal law pertaining to pensions, specifically referencing ERISA, prohibited garnishment after the pension benefits were distributed to Mr. Jackson. The district court also examined whether Colorado law or Texas law provided any exemption that might prevent creditors from seizing pension funds once they left the pension plan and were placed either in a bank or under Mr. Jackson’s direct control. The dispute thus centered on whether those funds remained shielded from collection under either federal or state provisions, or alternatively, if garnishment could lawfully attach to those monies once they were in Mr. Jackson’s hands.

 In support of Mr. Jackson’s position, several arguments were advanced. First, some pointed to statutory text suggesting that pension payments should remain protected from forced collection, even after distribution, to ensure retirees actually receive sustained income in accordance with federal objectives that seek to secure retirement benefits. Provisions that prohibit the assignment or alienation of pension benefits were cited, with an emphasis on the idea that once Congress has declared these benefits must be safeguarded, that protection should not evaporate the moment the beneficiary receives the funds. Additionally, it was argued that federal regulations, which describe what constitutes an impermissible assignment or alienation, do not necessarily allow creditors to overpower the fundamental intent that retirement income be preserved for the participant. Comparisons were drawn to other statutes, such as the Social Security Act or the Veterans’ Benefits Act, where courts have applied protective language to funds even after distribution, underscoring the principle that the textual differences need not prevent federal pension law from being interpreted in a similarly protective way. In tandem with these federal arguments, Mr. Jackson invoked Colorado’s and Texas’s general exemption statutes, suggesting that multiple states expressly choose to exempt certain types of pension or retirement proceeds from garnishment. Supporters of Mr. Jackson contended that these state enactments should not be displaced by federal preemption arguments. They reasoned that state laws protecting post-distribution pension amounts are grounded in long-standing concepts that shield a certain percentage of earnings or certain categories of retirement benefits after payment.

 On the other side, arguments were laid out for why Local Collective #6 ought to be able to garnish the funds. It was noted that the text of ERISA’s anti-alienation provisions makes no explicit reference to funds after they have been paid to a beneficiary. Supporters of Local Collective #6 claimed that the crucial aspect of the law focuses strictly on protecting benefits while they remain in the control of the pension plan, and that once such benefits are disbursed, creditors can lawfully proceed against them just like any other asset. They cited federal regulations indicating that an alienation or assignment must result in a right enforceable against the pension plan itself—implying that once funds have transferred to an individual’s account, creditors no longer seek to enforce anything directly against the plan. Moreover, they relied on language in other federal statutes, such as the Social Security Act or the Veterans’ Benefits Act, to demonstrate how Congress has expressly stated in those acts that both future and paid benefits are shielded. Local Collective #6 asserted that these examples show that, in contrast to those statutes, federal pension law does not specifically mention protecting “moneys paid.” In addition, they advanced the position that any state law purporting to protect retirement payouts post-distribution would distort the uniformity that federal law aims to maintain in the area of pensions, thereby rendering the state provisions inapplicable by virtue of preemption. Finally, they argued that if certain states’ exemption regimes were interpreted to apply broadly, it would undermine settled creditor rights under federal law and would go beyond the scope originally intended for shielding retirement funds before payment.
