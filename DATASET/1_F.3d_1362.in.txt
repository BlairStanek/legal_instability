You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Jordan Hill worked for many years installing pipes at a large refinery operated by Merit Oil Harbor Shores Inc. His tasks at this facility required frequent cutting and handling of a product called K–Therm, which, over time, he came to believe contained asbestos. Jordan Hill later brought a claim alleging significant harm to his lungs because of his exposure to K–Therm. In the litigation involving Jordan Hill and Robin Fiberglass Inc., K–Therm was traced to Robin Fiberglass Inc. as its distributor and eventual manufacturer.

 Jordan Hill testified that he suffered persistent dust exposure from morning until he left work, which he said resulted in pleural scarring around his lungs and, as his medical witnesses contended, a gradual reduction in his breathing capacity. He was also concerned about developing cancer in the future, citing friends and former co-workers who had died from asbestos-related diseases. While Jordan Hill initially enjoyed various athletic pursuits, including running, swimming, and weight lifting, he said that his respiratory challenges limited his participation in these activities. In addition to his own testimony, he presented opinions from physicians such as Dr. Bradley Anderson and Dr. Paul Roberts, both of whom concluded that his breathing problems were consistent with asbestos-related illness.

 In contesting Jordan Hill’s claims, Robin Fiberglass Inc. relied on internal records, expert witnesses, and medical notes documenting that Jordan Hill had undergone knee and shoulder surgeries soon before trial. These records, prepared by a surgeon identified in the proceedings only as Dr. Orth, indicated that Jordan Hill continued to engage in substantial physical activity, including weight lifting and other strenuous pursuits. According to Robin Fiberglass Inc.’s medical expert, Dr. Michael Harris, the physical examinations and tests available did not conclusively prove an asbestos-induced disease. Moreover, Robin Fiberglass Inc. argued that larger awards in these kinds of cases could exhaust the resources needed for similarly situated claimants in the future, underscoring what it saw as the need for more moderate compensation across numerous pending and anticipated claims.

 In support of Jordan Hill, it was argued that the presence of pleural scarring around his lungs, along with evidence of asbestos fibers, amounts to a sufficient physical injury under principles contained in the Restatement (Second) of Torts. His counsel invoked precedents discussing even minor physical impact as potentially justifying claims for mental anguish, including a documented fear of cancer. His counsel pointed to sections of the Restatement indicating that manufacturers may be liable for harm if, by reasonable human skill and foresight, they should have known their products were hazardous. Emphasizing the findings of Dr. Anderson and Dr. Roberts, Jordan Hill’s legal team highlighted medical tests showing a steady decline in lung capacity, contending that this substantiated his claim of a progressively worsening condition. He also relied on studies, including ones historically distributed in the industry (like the Parker Report, introduced through the Textile Institute for Materials) that questioned the safety thresholds and reportedly showed that responsible companies should have done more thorough investigations into health risks. By referencing recognized doctrines on fear of future disease, Jordan Hill’s side underscored the emotional toll accompanying any abnormal pulmonary findings.

 Robin Fiberglass Inc., for its part, maintained that Jordan Hill did not demonstrate substantial physical impairment under recognized guidelines, citing materials from the National Pulmonary Society to argue that a mere presence of pleural scarring, without more, does not necessarily equate to a compensable suffering. The company also argued that industry-wide reports do not automatically impute knowledge to a particular company if that entity did not have access to them or was otherwise justifiably unaware of their conclusions. Moreover, Robin Fiberglass Inc. contended that Jordan Hill’s ability to engage in significant physical work, as shown by the pre-trial surgeon’s notes, undercut any claim of sizable current disability. Finally, Robin Fiberglass Inc. presented its view that disproportionate awards could diminish what should remain for future individuals who might have more severe injuries. By invoking the Restatement (Second) of Torts and stressing that compensatory damages ought to reflect actual harm, the company argued for caution in evaluating both the scale and certainty of Jordan Hill’s alleged physical and emotional injuries.
