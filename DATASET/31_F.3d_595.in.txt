You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this matter, John Doe had operated AM Autos in Town X, Missouri, dealing in upscale vehicles. He opened two checking accounts at Prime Bank in Town Y, Missouri, managed by Mark Roe, who was the president of Prime Bank at the time. Shortly after opening these accounts, they were closed, yet checks continued to be written on them. It was also alleged that John Doe opened an account at Delta Bank in Town Z, Missouri, and wrote several checks from there meant to reduce his outstanding debt at Prime Bank, which were later returned for insufficient funds. Around this period, John Doe had secured various lines of credit and financing for car purchases, and had pledged collateral—such as vehicles and his residence—to support these loans.

 While the accounts were closed, Mark Roe allegedly allowed John Doe to continue writing checks on them, rolling the amounts into loans on behalf of AM Autos. Some of these transactions were documented with promissory notes and security agreements. Multiple vehicles were pledged as collateral, and some were sold or double-pledged for other financing as well. Concurrently, auditors raised concerns about the unusual manner in which John Doe’s debt was managed, indicating that the loans were growing considerably and that some vehicles were being used or released under questionable circumstances.

 Beyond the dealings at Prime Bank, John Doe obtained a $30,000 loan from Kevin White, with Mark Roe guaranteeing that loan on behalf of Prime Bank. When John Doe’s checks from Delta Bank failed to clear, collateral was released before the checks returned for insufficient funds, and portions of that collateral were used again to secure other loans. Litigation arose between Prime Bank and John Doe concerning the outstanding balances and the bank’s attempts to seize automobiles. Ultimately, the parties reached a civil settlement that addressed issues related to the pledged collateral, the deed of trust on John Doe’s home, and personal guarantees. Despite this settlement, a substantial amount was written off by Prime Bank as uncollectible.

 Under one view of the dispute, the strongest legal arguments emphasize that bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 and the associated concept of depriving a financial institution of “honest services” under 18 U.S.C. § 1346 can be shown when established procedures are circumvented, collateral is handled in ways that create unsecured or undersecured obligations, and checks are knowingly written on accounts without proper funding. Citing interpretations of the bank fraud statutes, those supporting this position maintain that a scheme to defraud requires showing a departure from fundamental honesty and fair dealing. Further authority is drawn from case law stating that sending or approving checks on closed accounts can demonstrate an intent to defraud if evidence indicates the account holder knew the accounts were closed and worked in concert with a bank officer to extend credit surreptitiously. These arguments also stress that the loss analysis under U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 focuses on the actual or intended amount of loss attributable to criminal conduct and that securing loans or pledging collateral in a manner that obscures a bank’s true exposure satisfies the statutory elements.

 From the opposing perspective, the principal legal arguments emphasize that writing checks on closed accounts, if done with the knowledge and consent of a bank’s president, does not necessarily equate to a criminal plan, especially if the account holder believed the bank had converted the checks into standard loans without any deceit. These arguments lean on the principle that 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344 and 1346 require proof of fraudulent intent, and they underscore the absence of direct evidence showing the account holder deliberately sought to deprive the bank of honest services or property. Moreover, some arguments challenge whether the alleged “loss” was accurately measured, pointing to civil litigation settlements and potential counterclaims that might have offset or reduced the net loss to the bank. They also invoke the standard that sentencing should hinge on the actual loss traceable to the illegal conduct, questioning whether the write-off figure represents a bona fide criminal loss or a business decision influenced by other considerations.
