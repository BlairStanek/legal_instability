You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Argento served as a general partner in an enterprise known here as Maritime Partners No. 1, which was formed to acquire, operate, and eventually sell a motel property located in Olive Town, Oklahoma. Shortly after its establishment, Maritime Partners No. 1 entered into a contract with Delta Advisors of Oklahoma, Inc. for the day-to-day operation and management of the motel, referred to here as the Ponderosa Inn. The partnership itself did not handle hiring, firing, or the setting of wages for the motel’s staff; instead, Delta Advisors oversaw all employee matters and drew funds from certain accounts in order to handle payroll and associated taxes.

 At the time of the relevant tax assessments, separate parties held a mortgage on the Ponderosa Inn, and, exercising certain contractual rights, eventually required Maritime Partners No. 1 to replace Delta Advisors with another management company, Atlas Management Co. The motel was eventually transferred to Howland Street Investors in lieu of foreclosure. The Internal Revenue Service later assessed unpaid employment and withholding taxes from the last quarter of one tax year and the first two quarters of the following year, attributing those liabilities to Maritime Partners No. 1 and, by extension, Argento, who was personally levied.

 Argento paid the amount demanded by the Internal Revenue Service and then filed claims for a refund, arguing that Maritime Partners No. 1 was not the employer liable for the unpaid employment taxes. Confusion arose in part because the tax returns for the periods at issue listed Maritime Partners No. 1 or some variation thereof as the employer (along with what might have been one of its identification numbers). Argento’s position was that the proper employer was the management agent itself, which exclusively determined employee pay, handled the payroll accounts, and paid wages from funds to which Argento had limited access. The United States maintained that the partnership was listed as the employer and, under both the Internal Revenue Code and general agency principles, that the partners bore liability for the taxes.

 On one side, it is argued that the Internal Revenue Code requires the party having actual control over the payment of wages to withhold and pay employment taxes, pointing to key language in 26 U.S.C. § 3401(d). Under this position, because the managerial firm exercised full discretion over employee pay and maintained the relevant bank accounts, the managerial firm qualifies as the entity controlling wages. Additional references include interpretive accounts of 26 U.S.C. § 3401(d)(1) from various court decisions emphasizing “control of the payment” as the decisive standard. It is further contended that any nominal statements in a contract calling the partnership the “employer” cannot supersede what the Code itself provides. This side also cites examples of tax rulings and case law indicating that, where a party other than a named principal has the sole authority over hiring, firing, and paying workers, that other party should be regarded as the employer for employment tax purposes.

 On the other side, it is argued that the written agreement unambiguously designates Maritime Partners No. 1 as the employer of the motel’s staff, making the partnership directly responsible for all employee-related obligations, including taxes. This position cites the explicit contractual language where the partnership agrees to be “the employer” by name, while the management firm is described merely as an agent carrying out certain functions. By noting 26 U.S.C. § 3504, the contention is that a principal remains subject to all applicable tax obligations, even if the principal’s agent is the one physically making the payments. The argument stresses that private parties with equal bargaining power negotiated and understood the contract’s plain language, so the partnership became responsible for ensuring the federal employment taxes were paid. According to this interpretation, the presence of detailed arrangements and explicit designations indicates that the partnership cannot disclaim the legal obligations it took on by contract.
