You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Thomas Jacobs was charged with first degree murder after a police officer, here called Officer Henry Green, was killed. Jacobs’s first conviction and death sentence were reversed on direct review in the state supreme court, which remanded for a new trial. Before that second trial, the state legislature had passed a new death penalty statute. Jacobs was tried again, this time by a jury from which certain individuals opposed to capital punishment were removed (commonly called a “death-qualified” jury). That second jury convicted Jacobs, and a sentence of death was imposed under the new statute. Later, the state supreme court set aside only the death sentence, explaining that the statute did not apply retroactively to Jacobs’s case, and replaced it with a life sentence.

 After this direct appeal, Jacobs sought post-conviction relief under Pennsylvania’s Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) in the trial court. Initially, an appointed lawyer, here called Attorney James West, did not file an amended petition as ordered. Another appointed lawyer, here called Attorney Timothy Clark, also did not file one. Only much later did a third appointed lawyer, here called Attorney David Brown, file an amended petition. Meanwhile, Jacobs also filed a separate challenge in federal court, contending that delays in the trial court rendered any further state-level proceedings ineffective. In state court, no single, comprehensive docket sheet tracked the developments in Jacobs’s case, which, according to Jacobs, further complicated and prolonged his attempts to secure review.

 The Commonwealth responded to Jacobs’s federal filing by pointing to an interest in adjudicating the issues at the state level and noting that Jacobs could have filed additional state court motions on his own. According to the Commonwealth, Jacobs’s counsel and Jacobs himself bore some responsibility for any delays. Jacobs disputed this, insisting that his repeated requests for action went unheeded and that, under these circumstances, he had no realistic avenue to expedite the case in the trial court.

 In arguing for Jacobs, it was claimed that the lengthy delays in the trial court effectively denied him a prompt legal remedy, thus making other avenues of relief inadequate. Jacobs emphasized that two different lawyers, appointed for him at different points, did not file long-required amended papers, leaving his petition dormant. He also contended that the trial court’s system for recording filings lacked any easy method for tracking a pending petition, making it impossible for him to safeguard his own rights. Jacobs further argued that trying him before a death-qualified jury was incompatible with the Sixth Amendment when, under precedents like Lockhart v. McCree and Buchanan v. Kentucky, no valid reason existed to remove jurors opposed to capital punishment if he was not actually subject to a death sentence. He relied upon several federal cases highlighting a principle that extreme or unusual delay in the state system need not be tolerated under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b). Accordingly, Jacobs insisted that his constitutional challenges merited a thorough federal review despite incomplete state-level proceedings.

 In arguing for the Commonwealth, it was contended that the state has a strong interest in first resolving most claims in its own courts. The Commonwealth argued that Jacobs could have notified the trial court more forcefully of the incomplete filings or itself sought a direct order compelling action. Citing Rose v. Lundy and similar rulings, the Commonwealth maintained that federal courts should not intervene prematurely in habeas matters, especially in serious prosecutions. Regarding the death-qualified jury, the Commonwealth claimed that pertinent Supreme Court decisions allow the practice in cases initially considered subject to capital punishment and do not necessarily confirm that a jury becomes unfair solely by excluding those hesitant about the death penalty. The Commonwealth also noted that the newly created life sentence might cure alleged prejudice in this respect. Ultimately, it asserted that no constitutional violation arose just because lawyers did not file certain papers on time, especially if Jacobs remained able to litigate his claims in the state courts with counsel’s assistance.
