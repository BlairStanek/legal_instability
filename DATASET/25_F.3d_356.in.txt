You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Noah and Wendy Clark sought relief from certain educational debts, contending that repayment caused them considerable financial strain. These debts were guaranteed by Arcadia Student Loan Association, a nonprofit entity created to administer student loan programs. The Clarks initially filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and then asked a court to declare the student loans dischargeable. One key question was whether repaying the loans would impose a financial hardship on the Clarks.

 Noah Clark had taken out one student loan from Roseland College, while Wendy Clark had borrowed two additional loans, also guaranteed by Arcadia Student Loan Association. After finishing their studies, they encountered difficulties making payments and eventually made only a few partial installments. The Clarks pointed to their limited income and monthly expenses, which included costs for a school-aged child and a younger child, as leaving them with a monthly shortfall. In addition, they faced some medical expenses for their daughter’s asthma, which further strained their resources.

 Both Noah and Wendy Clark had some prospects for improved employment but no immediate assurance of higher income. Noah Clark was earning a modest salary at the Highland Mental Health Center, while Wendy Clark had previously worked at the Redwood County Alternative School, then received unemployment benefits, and was later unable to find a lasting position. During the period leading to their case, the Clarks provided monthly expense charts reflecting that their family budget still fell short of meeting basic needs if they were to pay the loans. Arcadia Student Loan Association argued that the Clarks’ overall circumstances did not justify discharging these particular debts. There was also discussion concerning whether any court might revisit the Clarks’ financial situation at a later time.

 In support of the Clarks, several points were raised about how 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8)(B) applies when an individual’s overall livelihood is threatened by student loan repayment. It was argued that the statutory reference to “undue hardship” should be read in light of case law such as Brunner v. New York State Higher Educ. Serv. Corp. and In re Roberson, which outline factors like maintaining a minimal standard of living, the likelihood of persistent financial difficulty, and the debtor’s good faith in attempting repayment. By focusing on the Clarks’ limited hours, modest salaries, significant child-related expenses, and history of making a few payments when possible, they maintained that these facts showed both good faith and a genuine long-term inability to repay. Proponents of the Clarks’ position also pointed to the need for a “fresh start” under bankruptcy principles and invoked the broad equitable powers of courts, including provisions like 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), to grant additional relief if necessary to protect struggling debtors. They contended that the law was meant to prevent mere opportunistic use of bankruptcy but not to condemn individuals to ongoing destitution when their resources remain minimal.

 In support of Arcadia Student Loan Association, it was argued that the presumption against discharging student loans—reflected in 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8)—places a substantial burden on borrowers to prove that repayment is untenable. Citing cases that require a “certainty of hopelessness,” Arcadia maintained that debtors must demonstrate severe ongoing impediments to earning sufficient income for most of the repayment period. Here, they pointed out that the Clarks were college-educated, not physically disabled, and not advanced in years, while also acknowledging Noah Clark’s possibility of a promotion and Wendy Clark’s potential return to educational or related work. They emphasized that the Clarks had made only token payments over several years and never sought a deferment or other less drastic remedy than discharge. Moreover, Arcadia contended that any action to delay a formal ruling on whether a loan is dischargeable falls outside routine equitable powers under 11 U.S.C. § 105(a), since that provision cannot be used to set aside or sidestep important statutory directives about final determinations, especially where a debt is presumptively excluded from discharge except in narrow circumstances.
