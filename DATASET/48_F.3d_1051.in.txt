You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Carter’s Notable Corned Beef Company operates a meat processing facility that employs between 25 and 80 individuals. Patricia Evans was hired there in the mid-1980s as a laborer and later became a full-time employee. Within the facility, one level was traditionally staffed by male employees in union positions, and a different level was staffed by female employees in non-union positions.

 Evans and other women noticed that male employees were union members of the Independent Butchers Union #1 and received higher wages and other benefits that union membership provided. Evans repeatedly asked when the women’s wages would be aligned with those of the male workers or when they would be allowed to join the union. She alleges that representatives of the company made assurances that these issues would be addressed. Eventually, Evans filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging discrimination under Title VII, the Equal Pay Act, and the Missouri Human Rights Act.

 During the period at issue, there were several events Evans cites as relevant: the company’s classification of her role as non-union despite similar duties shared by those in union positions, the delay in allowing any woman to join the union, and the apparent wage disparity between female and male employees. She also points to a layoff in mid-1992, which she believes was related to inadequate seniority and discriminatory practices. In response, the company argues it faced difficulties in defending against the allegations, including the loss of key personnel knowledgeable about the relevant practices.

 In support of Carter’s Notable Corned Beef Company prevailing, one argument highlights that Title VII and related statutes place time limits on filing charges, and principles of equity can account for evidentiary prejudice caused by lengthy delays. Proponents of this position point to precedents emphasizing that when a claimant waits an extended period before bringing a complaint, potential witnesses may be unavailable, and crucial evidence may be lost. Citing authority that laches and timeliness requirements help ensure fairness for employers, they maintain that lengthy postponement of administrative or legal action undermines the reliability of the fact-finding process. Accordingly, advocates assert that the alleged delay in filing charges, paired with the practical hardships caused by the passage of time, strongly supports a defense grounded in both statutory limitations and equitable doctrines.

 In support of Patricia Evans prevailing, one argument stresses that Title VII provides for claims to be brought within three hundred days of the alleged unlawful employment practice, and the Missouri Human Rights Act requires filing within one hundred eighty days, which Evans believes she satisfied. Proponents of her position argue that the continuing nature of wage disparity or membership restriction can extend or toll these filing deadlines, so earlier actions are arguably linked to ongoing discriminatory practices. They contend that equitable doctrines like laches should not override applicable statutory protections—especially where notice is eventually given within the time frames established by law—because employees often depend on repeated assurances of improvement. They assert that any delay in initiating formal proceedings can be excused where the employer’s own representations contributed to an employee’s decision to postpone filing.
