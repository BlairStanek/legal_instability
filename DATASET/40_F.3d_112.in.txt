You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In River City, local government bodies approved plans for an aquarium and a riverfront park on the Smith Street Wharf. The Riverland Preservation Society, comprising landowners in the Old Quarter District, expressed concerns that these plans would compromise the district’s historic character. The project involved building and modifying certain structures in an area adjacent to navigable waters under the purview of the Army Corps of Engineers. From the start, the Riverland Preservation Society questioned whether all the necessary reviews had been properly conducted.

 A central point of contention revolved around the permitting process required by the Rivers and Harbors Act. The Riverland Preservation Society argued that because the wharf construction could affect navigable waters, an individual permit should have been required, which would have triggered specific historic preservation procedures. Erickson and others involved in overseeing the project maintained that a general or nationwide permit was enough, since they deemed the park segment to be an inconsequential alteration that did not interfere with navigation.

 Further disputes arose over certain internal regulations that require consideration of historical effects on properties recognized for their cultural significance. The Riverland Preservation Society claimed that these reviews and consultations were either insufficient or altogether neglected, pointing to possible traffic and aesthetic changes the park might bring to the Old Quarter District. Erickson and local officials responded that the wharf’s key maritime function had been retained and that only minimal land-side surface alterations were introduced.

 Erickson contends that the governing federal rules and the Rivers and Harbors Act permit reliance on a general, nationwide permit where a project minimally affects navigable capacity. Under this view, detailed historic reviews are only mandated for activities with a more substantial impact. Erickson cites agency regulations in 33 C.F.R. §§ 320–330 to emphasize that longstanding precedents grant agencies broad discretion over when to require individual permits, especially if navigable waters remain largely unaffected. According to Erickson, the modifications on Smith Street Wharf satisfied the criteria for a more streamlined approach, and the law did not call for additional procedures under these circumstances.

 The Riverland Preservation Society insists, in contrast, that federal rules such as 33 C.F.R. § 330.5(b)(9) require clear consultation processes when a project may harm recognized historic resources. They highlight that the National Historic Preservation Act imposes obligations on federal agencies to ensure potential adverse effects on historic landmarks receive proper scrutiny. In their view, any weakening or bypassing of these protective steps undermines the validity of the permit. Drawing on preservation-focused precedents, they assert that even modest developments can accumulate tangible harms in historically sensitive districts, and that a fuller inquiry was necessary before proceeding.
