You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Brandon Parker was arrested in the early morning hours after being seen discarding mail into a dumpster near a broken mailbox. Found with mail and related items, he later admitted to having taken letters from that mailbox. A grand jury charged him under 18 U.S.C. § 1708, and he pleaded guilty. Prior to sentencing, a presentence report detailed Parker’s criminal record, which spanned roughly two decades. The probation department calculated his criminal history points and concluded that he fell into the highest available criminal history category under the sentencing guidelines.

 The district court noted that this criminal history calculation did not include several older offenses because they were considered too distant in time, nor did it account for certain arrests and bench warrants. At the time of the offense, Parker was on bail for pending charges and was also on probation from a previous sentence. Additional pending matters, some involving similar mailbox-related allegations, and multiple bench warrants were also noted. Though Parker received a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility, the district court decided that his criminal history category did not fully capture his past wrongdoing.

 The sentencing judge recounted the details of Parker’s record—convictions for trespass, drug possession, sexual misconduct, larceny, and other offenses. Parker argued that because his point total already placed him in the highest criminal history category, it was inappropriate to impose any additional penalty. He also urged that many of his prior offenses were minor or too remote in time and that lower increments of additional punishment should be considered before a more severe term could be given. The district court elected to depart from the recommended range without explaining its precise method for calculating or selecting the final sentence.

 In support of a lengthier term, The Government points to guidelines provisions allowing increased punishment when the assigned criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness or persistence of a defendant’s lawbreaking, citing U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3. It highlights the breadth of Parker’s record, noting that many convictions were excluded only because they occurred earlier in his life, and urges that no rigid formula should restrict a judge’s discretion to extend the punishment beyond the highest category. The Government asserts that precedent confirms a court’s authority to depart upward in cases featuring lengthy recidivist behavior. It stresses that statutes and the federal sentencing guidelines envision exactly this sort of discretion, requiring merely that a sentencing court articulate a reasoned basis in law and fact, rather than adhere to any strict, mechanical approach.

 In favor of a lesser term, Parker emphasizes that the guidelines explicitly set a highest criminal history category and contends that departures beyond it should be exceptionally rare. He relies on case law suggesting that extraordinary or especially grave circumstances—beyond simple repetition of non-violent offenses—are needed to depart above the maximum category. He argues further that the judge must systematically consider less drastic increases before imposing a more severe term, moving methodically from smaller potential increases to larger ones. By skipping an incremental analysis in open court, Parker maintains the judge failed to show why a more moderate penalty was inappropriate. He also contends that guidelines commentary and certain decisions interpreting similar provisions call for specific justifications for how far beyond the highest category a court may go, especially when substantial increases are at issue.
