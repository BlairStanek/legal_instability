You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A federal grand jury began investigating individuals believed to be involved in distributing marijuana. This investigation centered on members of the Rousakis family, including relatives identified as Jordan and Jesse, and their alleged activities in Florida, Michigan, and Texas. During this investigation, Michael Casey was subpoenaed to testify before the same grand jury, and he initially invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. After being granted use immunity under 18 U.S.C. § 6002, Casey gave testimony in which he denied involvement in storing or distributing marijuana and stated that he had only casual or business relationships with Jordan and Jesse. Casey also identified acquaintance ties to other individuals, including one person who had allegedly been arrested for transporting marijuana. After some time, the same grand jury returned a superseding indictment that named Casey as a co-conspirator.

 Following Casey’s immunized appearance, an agent with a federal law enforcement agency (the “Agent”) gave testimony to the grand jury, explaining that three separate individuals had supplied information identifying Casey as a participant in the suspected marijuana operation. These individuals—named Ross McKenzie, Bailey Carter, and Victor Hines—each gave statements implicating Casey. Their accounts described situations in which Casey’s home in Riverside, Michigan, allegedly stored marijuana. One witness claimed that he and one of the Rousakis brothers had visited Casey’s home to retrieve bales of marijuana from the garage. Another witness claimed that funds or marijuana had been exchanged at Casey’s residence.

 Casey subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the evidence presented to the grand jury was derived from his compelled testimony—in other words, that his exculpatory statements, as well as the time he spent in front of that same grand jury, had tainted the decision to indict. Casey claimed that the government could not demonstrate that its evidence came from sources wholly independent of his immunized testimony and that, even if he had testified only in a self-exculpatory manner, his words might have swayed the grand jury in its assessment of his credibility. The government, on the other hand, responded that it had sufficient information about Casey’s involvement from the three private witnesses and that its case against Casey was not helped by his immunized statements at all.

 In support of the first party’s position, arguments emphasized that lawful indictments are based on evidence independent from a defendant’s compelled testimony, invoking Kastigar v. United States and the principle that use immunity prohibits only direct or indirect exploitation of what the witness reveals under compulsion. It was asserted that the government retains the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the course of its investigation, and any eventual indictment, did not rely on that testimony or leads stemming from it. The view was that Casey’s denials and minimal admissions, combined with separate incriminating accounts from private witnesses, meant that nothing Casey said actually assisted the investigation. Proponents of this view contended that as long as the government demonstrates an independent basis, there should be no per se prohibition on the same grand jury returning an indictment following immunized testimony. They rested these arguments on precedent such as Kastigar, emphasizing the government’s “affirmative duty” to establish its independence from compelled disclosures, along with further case law (including United States v. Hinton, United States v. Zielezinski, United States v. Garrett, and United States v. North) that discusses how evidence from legitimate sources may be sufficient to support an indictment despite a witness having testified under immunity.

 In support of the other party’s position, arguments stressed the difficulty of separating a witness’s immunized testimony from a grand jury’s deliberative process. Relying on precedent interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 6002 and the Fifth Amendment, this side claimed that providing compelled testimony before the same group of grand jurors who ultimately decide to indict creates a real risk that jurors may use that testimony—either as an implicit admission of guilt or as suspicious denial. Advocates of this position called into question whether subsequent evidence or statements can ever be truly independent if the same grand jury heard the immunized testimony first. Citing cases such as United States v. Hinton, they argued that the best protection against an impermissible use of compelled testimony might be a broad prohibition on allowing the same grand jury to indict. Such a prohibition, in their view, would best safeguard the constitutional protection against self-incrimination by removing even the appearance that the grand jury’s decision could be influenced by compelled testimony. They also stressed that the very presentation of compelled statements risks shaping the questions or the perspective of the grand jury in ways that are often impossible to uncover through later hearings.
