You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Investigators from the state motor vehicle division arrived at James Adler’s auto repair establishment without prior announcement. They began by examining car parts stored in an open lot connected to the business. This lot was part of Adler’s overall premises, which he used to purchase, store, and sell used automobile parts.

 Partway through the search, the investigators moved from the open lot into an enclosed building and noticed that, since an earlier visit, a second-story area had been finished. One investigator asked Adler about the space, and Adler indicated that old auto parts were stored upstairs. According to the investigators, Adler gave permission for them to look in the attic; Adler disputed that he had done so. The investigators told Adler that a warrant was unnecessary under state law governing businesses that buy or sell used automobile parts. When they opened a door in a separate room in that attic area, they found marijuana.

 The United States subsequently charged Adler with drug-related offenses under federal law. In legal proceedings that followed, Adler sought to suppress the marijuana, stating that the search exceeded any legitimate scope of an administrative inspection. The parties disagreed about whether the relevant state statute properly authorized the investigators to conduct a warrantless search throughout all areas of the premises and whether, under that statute, the investigators were permitted to go beyond the inspection of records or visible vehicle parts to enter other private areas.

 In support of the United States, one argument is that Tenn. Code Ann. § 55-5-108 explicitly grants investigators authority to inspect businesses engaged in purchasing or selling used car parts. This argument points out that federal precedent, including New York v. Burger, recognizes warrantless administrative inspections in closely regulated industries if certain criteria are met. Proponents of this view argue that regulating the used auto parts industry is critical to deter theft, and that allowing inspections without prior notice strengthens the deterrent effect. Further, they maintain that such inspections must necessarily encompass vehicle components even if they are stored in separate areas of a business’s premises, because restricting searches only to places in plain view or to a review of paperwork would undermine the statute’s deterrent and enforcement goals. Citing New York v. Burger, they contend that as long as statutory provisions notify business owners that they may be inspected, and limit the scope of the inspection to vehicles and parts, then the law can serve as a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.

 In support of Adler, one argument challenges whether the state statute clearly authorizes going anywhere on the premises to search for auto parts. According to this view, the language requiring that certain records “be available” does not automatically confer authority to enter private areas of a business. Instead, the argument holds that investigators are limited to reviewing records and inspecting vehicles or components in public or open areas, unless there is proper consent or a warrant. Moreover, reliance on the administrative search exception is disputed on grounds that the statute, even if it contemplates some inspections, does not clearly advise owners that any private rooms where parts may be stored are also subject to search. This side maintains that the broader the physical scope of a search, the more rigorous the statutory and constitutional safeguards must be. Under this argument, allowing warrantless entry into private spaces goes beyond what New York v. Burger intended and fails to limit officials’ discretion to a sufficient degree, thus making the search impermissible in the absence of a warrant or valid consent.
