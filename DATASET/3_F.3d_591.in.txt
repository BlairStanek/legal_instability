You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In the mid-1980s, Monica Bradley (the decedent), who was elderly and in declining health, transferred her longtime personal residence to her only heir, Peter Bradley, along with Peter’s spouse, Rose Bradley. Shortly after this transfer, Monica continued living in the house until her death a couple of years later. At the time of the transfer, all parties were aware of Monica’s serious medical condition.

 As part of the transfer, there was a stated purchase price of $270,000. Monica immediately forgave $20,000 of that amount, and Peter and Rose executed a $250,000 mortgage note in favor of Monica. In addition, Peter and Rose entered into a lease agreement with Monica under which Monica paid monthly rent to them; at the same time, Peter and Rose made interest payments on the mortgage note to Monica. Over the couple of years until Monica’s death, these rent and interest amounts were almost equivalent in sum. Monica also forgave $20,000 of the mortgage principal each year, drawing on her annual per donee exclusion from the gift tax. Through testamentary provisions, she then forgave the remaining unpaid principal upon her death.

 Monica had originally reported the residence’s sale on her tax return, taking advantage of a one-time exclusion for the sale of a principal residence by an individual above a certain age. After Monica passed away, Peter and Rose sold the property to a third party for a significantly higher price. A dispute arose over whether, for federal estate tax purposes, the arrangement should or should not be considered a transfer with a retained life interest. The question also arose whether the transaction could qualify as a bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration under the tax laws.

 One set of arguments maintains that the transaction involved a retained right of possession or enjoyment because Monica effectively remained in control of the property. It is asserted that 26 U.S.C. § 2036 requires inclusion in the estate when property is transferred but the transferor continues living there under a mutual understanding. This side cites cases interpreting “possession or enjoyment” as continued beneficial use of the property, even absent an explicit written reservation. They maintain that the offsetting nature of the mortgage payments and rent, plus the ongoing forgiveness of the mortgage principal, shows no real economic shift of ownership; thus, any mortgage note allegedly had no genuine value if, from the beginning, the parties expected it to be forgiven. The arguments rely on legal precedents emphasizing that intrafamily transactions are scrutinized to determine if they are transfers in substance or merely on paper. Various rulings and case law on implied agreements, particularly in family contexts, are cited to show that if an individual retains the benefit of the property, then the property’s full value may be subject to estate taxation. They also note that if there was no actual prospect of repayment, then the payment obligation did not function as actual consideration, thereby undermining any claim to having made a bona fide sale for adequate and full consideration.

 The opposing arguments focus on the formal structure of the transaction, contending that Monica genuinely sold the property for a fair market price and that she became a tenant rather than retaining ownership benefits. This side points to the signed lease agreement, the monthly rent payments, and the fact that Peter and Rose assumed ownership responsibilities such as property taxes and insurance costs. They rely on a line of authority stating that a note supported by a valid, legally enforceable security interest can constitute adequate consideration, even if there is an intent to forgive it later. They emphasize that, under the federal gift tax rules, forgiving portions of a debt each year is consistent with the per donee exclusion, and merely indicates a separate gift rather than invalid consideration for the original sale. This side also argues that the transfer was structured to reflect legitimate reliance on age-based incentives for selling a principal residence under 26 U.S.C. § 121. According to these arguments, nothing in the arrangements, by itself, nullifies the sale’s bona fide character because taxpayers are entitled to structure transactions in ways that minimize tax liabilities, so long as those transactions occur pursuant to valid obligations and enforceable notes.
