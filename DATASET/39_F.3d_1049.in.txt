You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Mr. Delgado is originally from Iran and is also a citizen of Great Britain. He lived in Great Britain and then traveled to the United States, where his spouse and two children, both 14-year-old twins, were already residing as lawful permanent residents. After Mr. Delgado entered the country, he was convicted in the district court of conspiracy to defraud the government. That conviction led the Immigration and Naturalization Service to begin proceedings seeking Mr. Delgado’s deportation to Great Britain.

 During the deportation proceedings, Mr. Delgado sought relief from deportation. He asked that his status be changed to that of a lawful permanent resident based on his marriage to a lawful permanent resident. Because of his conviction, he needed a waiver of admissibility under certain provisions of federal immigration law that require a showing of “extreme hardship” to qualifying family members if he were removed. Mr. Delgado argued that, because of his role providing financial support and emotional stability, deportation would cause his spouse and children to experience hardship beyond the norm. In the course of the hearings, evidence was offered concerning the family’s close bond, Mr. Delgado’s concern for the children’s well-being, and the financial consequences if they remained in the United States without him or were forced to move abroad to remain unified.

 Mr. Delgado’s spouse also offered testimony describing their family as tightly knit. She stated that she depended on Mr. Delgado’s income to keep up certain financial obligations, including payments on their home, and that she would not be able to manage those responsibilities on her own. Mr. Delgado likewise testified that his children would suffer educationally and emotionally if separated from him, and that they would potentially lose important friends and community ties if forced to follow him to Great Britain. He maintained that at his age and with his background, finding employment back in Great Britain might be difficult, and that his family would be uprooted from the environment in which they had become settled.

 The strongest legal arguments offered in favor of the first party center on the statutory requirement that a waiver of inadmissibility based on hardship be granted only under exceptional circumstances. Citing authorities such as Matter of Ngai and Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, these arguments note that routine disruptions caused by moving to a foreign land and adjusting to new surroundings are insufficient to meet the legal standard. They point out that a clear showing of “extreme hardship,” rather than ordinary difficulties that any family would face upon relocation or separation, is required. Under this view, a party seeking the waiver must present specific documentation or testimony detailing the significant actual or potential injury to the qualifying relatives. General statements about inconvenience, the loss of familiar social networks, or routine financial difficulties do not, under this reasoning, rise to the level of injury that the statute sets forth. Citing Hassan v. INS and Matter of Chumpitazi, proponents of this approach emphasize that the law places the burden of proof on the individual requesting the waiver, and that absent concrete, detailed evidence of harm, a waiver cannot be justified.

 The strongest legal arguments offered in favor of the other party urge that courts must undertake a searching and fact-intensive examination of the potential harm to each family member, especially to dependent children and spouses. Under this theory, merely labeling certain hardships as “common results of deportation” deprives adjudicators of the flexibility to account properly for legitimate emotional, educational, and financial consequences. Drawing on precedent such as Cerrillo-Perez v. INS and Saldana v. INS, these arguments assert that the law requires an individualized assessment of how removal will affect each member of the family. Although many families experience some degree of hardship, the combination of disrupted education, inability to meet mortgage payments, emotional trauma, and the real possibility of dividing the household is said to surpass the ordinary impact of deportation. Citing Zavala-Bonilla v. INS, this viewpoint underscores that specific factual testimony—such as Mr. Delgado’s explanation of how integral he is to his children’s academic progress and emotional well-being—should be carefully weighed. Under this perspective, an in-depth inquiry that fully considers the family’s particular social, emotional, and financial situation is necessary to determine whether the statutory requirement of “extreme hardship” has been satisfied.
