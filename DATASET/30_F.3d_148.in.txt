You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Riverwise, Inc. is a New York corporation that supplied aviation parts to the Bolivian Air Force under contracts executed in the early 1980s. A dispute arose when Riverwise, Inc. claimed the Bolivian Air Force breached its contractual obligations, and Riverwise, Inc. initiated a lawsuit in a district court in New York seeking damages in excess of nine hundred thousand dollars. After an attempt at formal notice, the Bolivian Air Force did not initially appear in the lawsuit.

 When the Bolivian Air Force did not respond, Riverwise, Inc. pursued a default judgment against the Bolivian Air Force in that district court in New York. Riverwise, Inc. then provided further notice of a hearing on its motion for default. Those notices were sent by mail to various Bolivian officials in Marina City, Bolivia, and also to Bolivian representatives within the United States. Ultimately, the district court in New York entered a default judgment against the Bolivian Air Force, and Riverwise, Inc. later registered that judgment in a district court located in the Silver District.

 The Bolivian Air Force contested that district court’s authority under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, arguing that service did not follow the procedures required for a “foreign state” under section 1608(a). It contended that it should have been treated as part of Bolivia itself rather than as an agency or instrumentality. Riverwise, Inc. asserted that its service satisfied the steps required for an agency or instrumentality under section 1608(b). Both sides recognized there was also an underlying question of whether the Bolivian Air Force’s aviation activities fell within an exception to sovereign immunity for commercial conduct.

 Supporters of the Bolivian Air Force’s position refer to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act’s text in section 1608(a), emphasizing that where an entity is truly part of a foreign state, service of process must follow a specific path, including notice to the foreign affairs ministry. They argue that the Bolivian Air Force is necessarily aligned with the sovereign’s core governmental functions, pointing to historical precedents describing military forces as intertwined with acts that define sovereignty. They cite various other court decisions interpreting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to illustrate that military branches are consistently treated differently from separate commercial entities. Invoking the legislative structure that distinguishes between commercial enterprises and sovereign functions, they maintain that the Bolivian Air Force’s operations are inherently governmental rather than separate corporate activities. Under this reading, the text of section 1608(a) should apply because the Bolivian Air Force cannot be considered a separate legal person.

 Supporters of Riverwise, Inc.’s position rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1603(b), pointing out that “agency or instrumentality of a foreign state” includes entities that can sue or be sued in their own names, enter contracts in their own names, or hold property independently. They argue that the Bolivian Air Force has acted in a manner that suggests legal independence—citing contracts it entered and lawsuits referencing or involving it specifically. They stress legislative history indicating that an entity’s form, including the ability to conduct business on its own behalf, matters for categorizing it under section 1608(b). In their view, requiring service on the head of a foreign affairs ministry is unnecessary if the entity has a sufficiently distinct commercial or contractual identity. They also highlight past decisions allowing alternative processes for service when the facts show an entity essentially functions like a standalone legal person under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
