You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


On one occasion in Greenfield County (Virginia), Jordan Grace was in a holding area waiting for processing at a jail. According to Grace, he asked an inmate watchman for a cigarette, and upon lighting it, Eric Jensen ran toward him and swung a set of keys at Grace’s face. Grace claims that two swings missed, but the third struck his right hand, which he had raised to protect his face. Grace reports that immediately afterward, as he tried to report the incident to a desk sergeant, Jensen allegedly pushed him against a wall and threatened him. Grace says that he waited to file a formal complaint due to fear. Roughly five and a half months later, Grace asserted continued swelling and pain in his hand; two years after the incident, he stated that lingering problems remained in his thumb. Two other inmates signed affidavits stating they saw Jensen swing his keys at Grace’s face and then push Grace against a wall when Grace tried to speak to another official. One inmate affidavit also recounts verbal threats by Jensen.

 Eric Jensen, in his own affidavit, gives a different account. He states that Grace was not only smoking but also yelling, such that the jail’s staff could not perform a roll call. Jensen claims he told Grace to remain quiet and shut a door separating Grace from where the roll call was happening. Jensen denies hitting or threatening Grace. In a related affidavit, the jail’s classification officer indicated that documentation for Grace showed no hand-injury complaints or formal medical requests during his stay. Grace was transferred to another facility several months afterward.

 There is disagreement over whether force was needed to maintain order and whether Grace was causing a disturbance. There is also dispute over the extent of Grace’s alleged injury and whether it was physically or psychologically serious. Some statements reference persistent thumb pain and diminished mobility in Grace’s right hand. Others emphasize an absence of formal medical records regarding complaints about his hand, contending Grace had multiple medical evaluations without any confirmed injury. Grace, however, claims he repeatedly requested care and received no meaningful response.

 Arguments supporting Jordan Grace’s position highlight that, under the standards in cases such as Hudson v. McMillian, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the malicious or wanton infliction of pain without legitimate penological justification. Grace’s accounts and witness affidavits, if believed, suggest that Jensen acted violently in response to a minor infraction and struck Grace’s hand with heavy keys, potentially indicating malicious intent. These arguments underscore Grace’s statements about continued physical pain and emotional distress, citing the principle that both physical and psychological harm may be cognizable even where injuries appear minor. Supporters of this view maintain that striking a person’s face or hand for a minor infraction, especially without apparent cause, could be disproportionate under constitutional standards governing the use of force.

 Arguments supporting Eric Jensen’s position point to case law emphasizing the necessity of maintaining discipline within correctional facilities and permitting measured force to restore order. Jensen and those aligning with his account suggest that Grace was being disruptive at a time when staff needed to verify inmates for court transfers, making some intervention reasonable. They note that the Eighth Amendment does not reach de minimis or trivial force and that no solid medical documentation corroborates Grace’s injury claims. Jensen’s position also relies on the absence of medical treatment requests in Grace’s records, combined with affidavits stating that multiple medical checks revealed no injury. Through these observations, any force used could be viewed as moderate and justified by exigent security needs.
