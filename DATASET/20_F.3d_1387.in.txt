You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In the southeastern part of Michigan, Farnsworth and Redwood were among multiple individuals named in an indictment alleging a long-running plan involving the possession and distribution of illicit substances, including cocaine and heroin. The indictment also referred to purported instances of using or carrying a weapon in connection with those substances, as well as alleged attempts to threaten a potential witness. Redwood’s family operated a convenience store in a town near the southeastern part of Michigan, and it was alleged that this location served as a point for storing and distributing drugs. Farnsworth and a close associate were alleged to have enforced drug debts through intimidation or threats of violence. Various investigative leads and undercover contacts were said to implicate both Farnsworth and Redwood in these dealings.

 During the proceedings, there were reports of possible misconduct by one or more members of the jury. Allegedly, certain television news coverage about Farnsworth’s legal counsel reached some jurors, and questions arose about whether those reports could have influenced the deliberations. Relatedly, the trial record contains notes from at least one juror expressing reservations about how deliberations were handled. Separately, there were discussions about whether Redwood’s motion to sever his case from others should have been granted, given that some co-defendants faced firearm- and threat-related counts he was not initially tied to. The indictment’s structure also raised questions about whether Redwood’s involvement in any wrongdoing was part of a broader single conspiracy or should be viewed as a distinct arrangement.

 Farnsworth, said to be a main organizer, challenged the manner in which certain witnesses were managed in court. One government witness appeared in the courtroom despite a sequestration order and subsequently offered evidence about Farnsworth’s purported drug-related activities. There was also an incident in which a government witness and a different witness met, ostensibly to clarify potential criminal liability, leading to claims that the meeting might have violated the sequestration rules. In a separate matter, testimony surfaced that Farnsworth had inquired about whether someone would be willing to harm a federal agent, prompting legal debate over whether calling a witness to testify about this topic was permissible after Farnsworth had already been indicted.

 Those favoring the United States rely on multiple legal authorities to argue that any outside information reaching jurors did not necessarily entitle Farnsworth or Redwood to relief, particularly under Remmer v. United States and subsequent cases indicating that no presumption of prejudice arises solely from outside contacts. They emphasize that a hearing can be used to evaluate actual bias (United States v. Zelinka), and that courts have wide discretion in assessing whether extraneous information impacted a verdict (United States v. Shackelford). Regarding severance issues, they cite United States v. Swift and similar rulings, insisting that the counts and evidence were sufficiently related and that juries are presumed capable of distinguishing separate charges against co-defendants. On the question of a possible single conspiracy, precedents like United States v. Warner and United States v. Rios are invoked to show that overlapping participants and overlapping objectives can unify the criminal plan. They assert that statements introduced about Farnsworth’s intent to threaten a federal agent are permissible under principles that allow evidence of conduct occurring post-indictment, as long as there is a valid investigative purpose (United States v. R. Enterprises; George). On the unpublished fact of a possible sequestration violation, they point to cases such as United States v. Gibson to contend that the testimony should not be automatically excluded, absent a showing of deliberate collusion by prosecutors or prejudice to the defense.

 Those favoring Farnsworth counter that serious questions remain about whether jurors were exposed to prejudicial material referencing Farnsworth’s attorney, which might undermine the fairness of the trial. They reference the principle that improper contact or extraneous information may call for corrective measures, a thorough inquiry, or potential new proceedings (Remmer v. United States; United States v. Pennell). They also maintain that Redwood’s desire for severance was well-founded under cases like United States v. Warner and United States v. Gallo, given that Redwood faced different allegations from others whose charges included more violent conduct. As to whether Redwood’s activities amounted to a separate or distinct operation, they suggest an absence of proof tying him to all aspects of a broader conspiracy, warranting consideration of multiple conspiracies under United States v. Rios. With respect to the claimed conversation about harming a federal agent, they contend it was improperly developed after indictment, violating Farnsworth’s rights and going beyond what a grand jury’s inquiry may lawfully cover. Finally, concerning the rules on sequestration, they argue that bringing a testifying witness into direct contact with another witness still subject to examination constitutes a serious transgression under United States v. Gibson, thereby tainting any testimony obtained thereafter.
