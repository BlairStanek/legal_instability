You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


In this case, a group of seasonal agricultural workers, referred to here as Perez Collective, was recruited to pick produce during a particular harvest season in Washington. They assert they were promised certain wage rates and various employment benefits by Hanson North Grove and by individuals from an affiliated organization, renamed here as New Path Assistance. The workers claim these promises involved both verbal arrangements and agreed-upon terms when they were hired. The dispute centers on whether those obligations were met, and if not, what legal consequences should follow.

 According to allegations, some of the workers traveled long distances from their usual residences to reach the fields run by Hanson North Grove. Members of Perez Collective say they were promised that payment for their work would be at a set piece rate or an hourly rate, whichever was higher, along with other assurances such as transportation and timely disbursement of wages. Once the work finished, they claim that they either received lower compensation than what they had been told or did not receive relevant benefits that had been discussed, such as return travel arrangements. They further allege that necessary employment records were either improperly maintained or included misleading information.

 The parties’ dispute involves questions of whether the promises made by Hanson North Grove through New Path Assistance formed binding terms, either verbal or otherwise, and whether any statutes or regulatory measures require a particular standard of recordkeeping and truthful disclosure. Members of Perez Collective additionally claim they discovered inconsistencies in documentation only after the harvest concluded, which they contend prevented them from having a clear understanding of their pay and work conditions. Hanson North Grove and its affiliated recruiters, for their part, emphasize that any promises were conveyed in general discussions about potential work, and not all were as binding as Perez Collective insists. Some individuals associated with the recruiters assert that they merely offered space or assistance with the hiring process, rather than actively controlling the contractual terms.

 In support of Perez Collective’s position, arguments highlight that federal statutes governing migrant and seasonal agricultural workers contain provisions related to wages, working arrangements, safety, and the disclosure of accurate information. Certain precedents and legislative reports are cited to show how these statutes aim to protect vulnerable worker populations, stressing that the statute’s remedial purpose means it should be given a broad reading. References to cases such as Rivera v. Anaya and others underscore that courts often look to the nature of the claims—whether they stem from a breach of terms akin to contractual obligations—and argue that in analyzing the time available to bring claims, state rules on oral or implied contracts may be the most fitting analogy. This line of reasoning points to the idea that the workers relied on explicit and implicit agreements regarding wages and benefits—making it natural to classify their cause of action in a manner that aligns with contract-based time periods, especially since the protections at issue involve promised pay rates and work conditions. Supporters of Perez Collective’s side also argue that anything less than a more extended period to seek remedies might undercut the broad statutory goals, because workers in transient or difficult circumstances could lose the opportunity to pursue legitimate claims.

 Hanson North Grove’s arguments stress that these claims are, at their core, actions deriving from statutorily mandated obligations—rather than traditional contractual rights—and that the most appropriate state analogy is the shorter time limit that typically applies to liabilities created by legislation rather than to garden-variety contract disputes. They contend that the alleged agreements are overshadowed by regulatory rules, such that the claims implicate specific official protections unrelated to a straightforward bargain. The reasoning draws on a reading of the same precedents and statutory frameworks to say that the requirements in question do not neatly fit into typical contract law, and thus looking to limitations rules for statutorily imposed responsibilities is more appropriate. Such arguments further point out that the relevant federal statutes emphasize duties tied to registration, recordkeeping, and accurate disclosures—obligations that are imposed by regulation, not merely by private agreement, and which did not exist at common law. Therefore, they argue, states commonly apply a shorter timeframe for enforcing these special statutory duties, and adopting the more extended timeframe would deviate from how the same duties are generally classified and enforced in state systems.
