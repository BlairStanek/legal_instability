You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


A manager named Henry Adams, employed by WestValley Rail Company, overheard a radio exchange about a damaged switch at the Riverside, Wyoming railroad yard. After speaking separately with crew members, Adams learned that Alan Brooks, a brakeman represented by the Alliance of Transport Workers, had aligned a switch improperly, causing part of a train to run through the switch and damage it. As a result, Brooks was sent for a toxicological test at Sunset County Healthcare Center and was removed from service pending the results.

 Soon after, WestValley Rail Company informed Brooks that he would face an on-property hearing to investigate potential violations of the company's Rule G, which forbids certain conduct involving alcohol or drugs. During the hearing, the hearing officer claimed that Brooks smelled of alcohol and asked two other employees to confirm. While they acknowledged some smell, they could not verify its nature. The hearing eventually closed, and WestValley Rail Company discharged Brooks for allegedly violating Rule G. Brooks and the Alliance of Transport Workers challenged the termination, and the dispute proceeded to arbitration before a Public Law Board. The Board held that the hearing officer had ventured beyond the agreed-upon scope of the hearing in raising the odor concern, thereby denying Brooks a fair hearing. Consequently, the Board did not examine whether Brooks had used alcohol or drugs. Instead, it ordered Brooks reinstated, minus a penalty for his admitted mishandling of the switch.

 Unwilling to reinstate Brooks, WestValley Rail Company pursued a case in the district court, asking that the arbitration award be invalidated in light of an alleged violation of public policy against on-duty substance use in rail operations. Meanwhile, Brooks and the Alliance of Transport Workers sought to uphold the arbitration decision. In considering the arguments, the district court weighed the narrow statutory guidelines surrounding disputes under the Railway Labor Act, the question of employee protections concerning due process at on-property hearings, and the purported public policy requiring heightened safety measures in the rail industry due to the threat that drugs and alcohol might pose to the public.

 One set of arguments contends that well-established law and regulations—particularly those issued by the Federal Railroad Administration—create a strong public policy requiring rail carriers to remove individuals from active rail service if there is reason to believe those individuals used drugs or alcohol while responsible for critical operations. This side points to the detailed testing requirements in federal regulations, the authority given to rail carriers to immediately remove potentially impaired workers from safety-sensitive positions, and various statutes that address the dangers posed by substance impairment in regulated transportation settings. Supporters of this view emphasize that courts have historically refused to enforce agreements or awards if they contradict a recognized policy centered on public safety. Citing precedents discussing the public policy exception’s roots in laws and legal precedents, this viewpoint holds that reinstating an individual whose substance use was never meaningfully investigated or resolved would risk future hazards and conflict with existing federal rules obligating strict safety compliance by the rail industry.

 Another set of arguments emphasizes that the Railway Labor Act places extraordinarily strict limits on judicial review of arbitration awards, restricting review to certain narrowly defined reasons such as corruption or exceeding jurisdiction. This side underscores that courts should not simply add extra grounds for overturning an arbitral decision beyond those listed in the statute. In pressing this argument, proponents highlight that arbitration serves as the final step for minor disputes in the railroad sector and that Congress did not include public policy as a statutory basis for overturning awards. Referencing case law interpreting the Railway Labor Act’s limited scope of review, they argue that such decisions “mean exactly what they say,” and that courts should be reluctant to craft exceptions not clearly provided for in the Act itself. Consequently, this position holds that any further requirement for proof of a violation of drug or alcohol regulations should take place within the arbitration framework, not through a court’s separate judgment on public policy grounds.
