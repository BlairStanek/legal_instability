You will be doing legal analysis of how you think a court should decide based on the facts below:


Sunset Airlines and Starling Bank entered into an arrangement in which the bank would pick up checks from the Military Airlift Command at Pine Air Force Base in Illinois and then process and electronically transfer the check proceeds for Sunset Airlines’s benefit. This remittance processing was designed to provide Sunset Airlines with timely access to payments it was owed by the Military Airlift Command. As part of the procedure, the parties assigned lock box identification numbers (LBIDs) to facilitate correct routing. Sunset Airlines maintained a separate account in Fairwood at Orchard Bank, but Starling Bank would collect the checks in Illinois and then wire the proceeds to Sunset Airlines’s account elsewhere.

 The underlying controversy centers on a check for over six hundred thousand dollars, issued by the Military Airlift Command to Sunset Airlines for services rendered. Although the name of Sunset Airlines was clearly indicated, the LBID on the check belonged to another customer of Starling Bank, which here is referred to as Garden Financial Corporation. Because of that second LBID, Starling Bank processed the check as though Garden Financial Corporation were the intended recipient, causing Starling Bank to electronically transfer the money to Garden Financial Corporation’s account in Brightville, North Carolina. Sunset Airlines discovered months later that it had never received those funds.

 Sunset Airlines had previously sent invoices to the Military Airlift Command and asked that the LBID be placed on checks. It did so at Starling Bank’s request. However, Sunset Airlines’s invoice for the flight services in question did not include any LBID. When the check arrived at Starling Bank, the bank endorsed it with a notation to credit the “payee,” but in practice equated the payee with the incorrect LBID on the face of the check. Subsequently, the check proceeds were routed to Garden Financial Corporation, rather than to Sunset Airlines. Starling Bank had also issued statements to its customers, but Sunset Airlines states it did not see this check listed in its own statements. By the time the misrouting came to light, Garden Financial Corporation was insolvent, and Starling Bank and Sunset Airlines each contended the other should bear the loss.

 In support of Sunset Airlines prevailing in the dispute, it is argued that under the provisions of applicable state law (including Mo.Rev.Stat. §§ 400.3-117 and 400.4-213) the key event was the handling of a negotiable instrument—namely, the government-issued check. Because Sunset Airlines was named as the payee on the face of the check, the argument is that the bank was responsible for crediting Sunset Airlines and no one else. This position relies on the view that although the lock box number appeared on the face of the instrument, that LBID was merely descriptive and did not alter the named payee. Further, by processing the check inconsistent with its restrictive endorsement “credit payee,” Starling Bank allegedly violated the standard of ordinary care under the Uniform Commercial Code. According to this line of reasoning, once the bank received final settlement on the check, the bank was obligated as a collecting bank to account for the proceeds to the rightful payee. Sunset Airlines also points out that any indemnification or exculpatory language in the remittance processing agreements cannot realistically be used by the bank to disclaim basic duties of good faith and ordinary care as specified in the Uniform Commercial Code. Sunset Airlines thus argues that the statutory rules governing acceptance and collection of negotiable instruments clearly place the burden on Starling Bank for misrouting the proceeds, regardless of any lock box number.

 In support of Starling Bank prevailing in the dispute, it is argued that the entire transaction was truly about next-day electronic transfers, rather than a standard bank deposit relationship under the Uniform Commercial Code. Starling Bank notes that Sunset Airlines had sought special remittance processing and had executed both a Remittance Processing Agreement and a Wire Transfer of Funds Agreement. Within those agreements, Sunset Airlines had agreed to indemnify and hold the bank harmless for losses that might result, except in cases of gross negligence or bad faith. Starling Bank contends it acted in a manner consistent with industry practice, processing items by the lock box identification numbers provided. It maintains that it did not act in bad faith, it did not lack ordinary care, and the contract language places the burden of such an error on Sunset Airlines. Starling Bank also relies on alleged errors by Sunset Airlines, including failing to reconcile its statements or to include the correct LBID on its invoices, and mistakes by the Military Airlift Command in using the wrong LBID on the face of the check. In Starling Bank’s view, this factual backdrop supports enforcing the indemnification clause and absolving it of liability for what it characterizes as a mere routing error that Sunset Airlines contractually agreed to cover.
